The Shawshank Redemption	R	10	8	6	4	2	"References to prison rape, a man and woman make out in the opening scene (no nudity), nude posters in prison cells. In the beginning, Andy sees his wife cheating. Three seconds of mild thrusting, fully clothed and shown from the shoulders up. New prisoners are brought into the prison nude. Bare buttocks are seen. There may be brief glimpses of genitals. There's some sexual dialogue present between the prisoners. A bare buttock visible during herd shower scene Brief male nudity (Buttocks), suggestive posters hanging on walls, a make out scene and prison rape that isn't shown but heavily implied. The main character is referenced to getting in a ""routine"" in which he is prison raped by a gang of men. The act is never shown but it is heavily implied by showing the men approach Andy. The actual nudity is very limited, brief male rear nudity is shown in the showers a few times and if you look extremely closely you can make out a few nude posters on the wall. The group that routinely gang rapes the protagonist references oral sex during an assault by telling the main character he will swallow whatever he's given to swallow. Nothing is shown onscreen. Pictures of girls show some of their bodies naked in the cell In one scene you could see bloody gun shots on a man. There is a shirt on him so you don't see the injury. A man is shot 4 times very quickly in the chest, the blood is seen and after we see him laying on the ground In a pool of blood. A narration implies that rape is an occurrence for Andy. One scene involves the same men who usually terrorize him punching and kicking him against the ground and says he will put his penis in Andy's mouth to which Andy replies they shouldn't do that. Non graphic. A man hits two others in the face with a film roll. He is then punched twice in the chest and once across the jaw (a dot of blood on his mouth). Shortly after, he is kicked four times in the stomach and hit across the face twice (seen from a distance). We then hear he spent a month in the infirmary. A man is hit five times and kicked once. He tries to crawl away, but is dragged offscreen and is implied to be still beaten up. He is then seen injured and bruised in a wheelchair for a few seconds and we hear he spent the rest of his life in a hospital. Not for kids. A man tries to fend off a few people in a fight and is beaten offscreen. It's also briefly referenced that he was raped. He then walks with a few bruises seen shortly on his face. A man is beaten up by a prison guard, with 12 blows landing. No blood or injuries are visible due to the dark lighting, most of the blows are offscreen. It is later revealed that he died from his injuries. One man holds a knife to another man's throat, a tiny wound is seen on his neck. A man says he can get people 'reefers' (no other interaction or any smoking or using it however at all) Men drink beer after along days work . And a prisoner gets cigarettes for his fellow inmates. People drink beer on a rooftop in one particular scene. One man is drunk and he holds a whiskey bottle in his hands. People smoke in several scenes. Prisoners deal cigarettes secretly among the bedsheets. The movie can be sometimes harsh and dark in tone. Prisoners torment and verbally attack new people who've just arrived, their reactions can be a bit difficult to watch as they scream and cry. The beatings may be intense to many. There are moments of moderate threat when characters are threatened (normally by guards). The prison rape elements could be distressing but, it is never shown just vaguely implied and briefly referenced. ""Christ"" is blasphemed early on in the movie. 34 uses of ""fuck"" (2 being ""motherfucker""), 3 uses each of ""dick"" and ""prick"", 2 uses of bastard, 42 uses of ""shit"" including 6 uses of ""bullshit"", 2 uses of ""shit head"" and 2 uses of ""horse shit"". Also the phrase ""Fresh Fish"" is used frequently. 1 use of ""cock"", 12 uses of ""goddamn"", 9 uses of ""hell"", and 3 uses of ""bitch"""

The Dark Knight	PG-13	5	16	5	14	1	"During an evening meal a woman wears a very low dress On a sailboat several women in the background are wearing bikinis No nudity 2 or three kiss in the movie Bruce Wayne walks in on a couple that is about to have sex, and when he opens a secret passage to the batcaves, the couple assumes that it is a safe room where they can do it in private. Played for laughs and very subtle. There are extremely pervasive and frightening moments of menace, and threats, primarily by the main antagonist of The Joker, who wears horrific clown make-up to scare people and to hide the graphic scars on his cheeks. It is implied that the Joker has the remaining mob boss killed and fed to his own dogs before taking his place. Two-Face hits a girl when deciding not to kill her. As Batman is fighting the Joker and his henchmen, the Joker has a hidden knife blade in the toe of his shoe witch he uses to kick Batman in the rib the scene. This then cuts to Batman shouting in pain before throwing the Joker to the floor. Frequent and prolonged scenes of violence throughout. There are multiple shootings, stabbings, fistfights, explosions, bombings, and burnings. However the violence is only of a moderate quality and never bloody or gory. The Joker slams a pencil into a man's eye brutally. No blood or gore shown. A building is blown up Apart from Harvey Dent's scarred face, there is no blood or gore that is visibly seen throughout the entire film. There is a scene where it is implied that the Joker slashes the cheeks of another man in a Glasgow smile/Chelsea grin. We see nothing as the camera cuts away as it happens, but the actions are quite clear nonetheless. A man is shown hanging from a noose in front of a window in a ""jump"" scene, and he is already dead when he is dropped. A man is bitten and another is mauled by a dog, there is blood shown later during the first and the second doesn't show any at all. A man suffers intense burns to one side of his face, later the muscle and bone are visible in areas and his eyelid is burned away to expose his whole eyeball. A woman dies in a flaming explosion. The camera cuts to show the outside and the building blowing up so we see nothing of her death. There is a scene in which a man is shown to have a bomb sewn under his skin. When it later explodes although the camera cuts to show the explosion from another window, and the man can still be been seen blowing up into a blood red smoke cloud. A man has his legs broken, after being dropped from a small height. The breaking is audible and you see his legs crumple under him. Despite the nature of these scenes, there is no real gore and there is very, very little blood. However, the violence is discussed openly, and the Joker, who's the main perpetrator, often boasts or explains the violence graphically. He also declares that people will die and brutally murders several in quick succession. We see a drug dealer (No on-screen drugs though) Somebody is smoking a cigar. And some people drink (not focused on at all) There is a scene where a man is about to drink, but is interrupted. A man quickly drinks two shots of whiskey. A drug dealer is displeased with the man who supplies his trade. The drugs are indicated to have been laced with a hallucinogenic and a man is shown suffering from intense hallucinations and calling out in terror on the floor. We see nothing but him thrashing and the drugs themselves are not shown, only mentioned. We see a mobster constantly smoke a cigar, smoking in almost every scene he appears in. A dead man is seen hanging briefly. The Joker tells two upsetting stories of how he got his scars. Two Face threatens to blow up a house. The iconic Joker interrogation scene can disturb viewers. The Joker taunts Two-Face, encouraging him to kill himself. Two-Face's descent into madness is chilling and may be difficult to watch for some viewers. The appearances of the super-villains in the film can be disturbing. The Scarecrow's burlap mask is creepy, and Two-Face's scarred face is gruesome. Of course, the Joker's makeup and Glasgow smile are extremely scary, especially for younger viewers. The Joker's bizarre, nihilistic personality is terrifying. The rubber clown-masks of the Joker goons are mildly frightening. The ending can be very intense for some. The film's tone is very dark and gritty. Almost every scene with Joker is pretty Intense but isn't so scary you'll be afraid to watch. The Jokers eerie laugh and constant salacious licking of his lips is unsettling. Batman and a cop race to rescue two hostages. A few uses of ''hell'', ''damn'', ''son of a b*tch"" and ""ass""."

Schindler's List	R	12	19	1	8	1	"Women take off their clothes and enter a shower. During this scene, their breasts, buttocks, and pubic hair is visible. The nudity in this movie is mostly non sexual nudity and is full frontal and rear of mostly females with only a couple quick glimpses of full frontal males; 4 to 5 scenes that show topless women. This film does show nudity, but a lot of it is non-sexual and shows what the Holocaust was actually like. The nudity is even briefer due to the black and white coloring except when focused on womens breast's and women removing clothes to shower. A woman is shown removing her dress with nothing underneath as the camera shows her breasts and pubic area for quite a while while women around her get undressed. Men and women take off their clothes and run in circles and men are forced to do ""squats"" to humiliate them as their penises are shown. A woman lies in Goeth's bed. Her breasts are clearly seen in various shots each lasting for 5-10 seconds. A man kisses one woman after another A woman wears a shirt that allows the form of her nipples to be seen at times. A man grabs a woman's clothed breast against her will. A man kisses a woman who does not want to be kissed Many Jewish prisoners are seen being forced to strip, run, and be examined. Full-frontal nudity of both women and men. Most times, the nudity is shown quite briefly. Oskar's mistress is reclining on the bed, and her breasts are seen and as she sits up she is wearing very loose and flimsy short shorts and the crack of her vagina is clearly shown. Lots of scenes of Nazis murdering innocent people and multiple scenes of brutality against innocent people. One of the most realistic and true to life depictions of violence in cinematic history A woman engineer is shot in back of her head after arguing about a building's structure with a Nazi officer. Blood flow is seen on the ground. A Nazi officer and his men confront a group of Jewish prisoners over a stolen chicken. When no one talks, he and one of his men shoot one of them at point blank range in the stomach and shoots the man a second time in the head; blood is seen pooling from his head. As the officer is about to shoot another one, a young boy steps up claiming that the dead man is the culprit. Although this movie doesn't contain a bunch of over-the-top blood and gore its still very disturbing since you see tons of innocent people getting senselessly murdered including children.. There is a sequence that lasts roughly three minutes that depicts the liquidation of the Warsaw ghetto. The sequence shows dozens of Jews being executed, however, unlike most executions in the film, barely any blood or gore is shown. The film presents a horrific, stomach-wrenching depiction of the holocaust: many, many people are seen being killed in one form or another. They are shot at point blank range, children are slaughtered, many more are killed in gas chambers. It is the kind of violence that stays with one for a long time. It is VERY, very disturbing because it is not only graphic, but also very realistic. A one-armed man struggles to shovel snow. Two Nazis shoot him; blood is seen pooling on the ground. A woman is shot through the back of the head, shown from a distance. A small bullet wound hole is shown, with blood briefly spurting and pouring on the ground. A man is pulled away from the other Jews leaving their homes, and is shot in the back of the head; the top of his head explodes and tears apart, blood pools and spurts around him. A man with an ill wife tries to tell a Nazi about her condition. Instead, she is shot in the head. Blood splatters on the man's face from the shot, and spurts from the wife's head while the man cries. A group of people hiding in a bedroom are shot (including children), one by one. The shots are offscreen, as a German Nazi official plays a cheery tune on the piano. A man wakes up and nonchalantly executes Jews through a window with a sniper rifle. When a man deems a worker to be unproductive, he marches him outside and attempts to execute him. However, despite trying two pistols, both mechanisms jam and he ends up beating the worker instead. A pile of bloody bodies is seen outside a building. A group of hospital patients are executed by Nazis with machine guns. The nurses give out cyanide to patients so they don't die from being shot. A man intimidates a young woman; she cries, and then he beats her. He pushes a shelf of wine on top of her, but she is not killed. A soldier shoots a little boy in the chest while two other soldiers hold the boy up. There is no blood: only feathers from his jacket. Dead bodies are dug up to be burned. There is a heap of them already being incinerated. Several characters are seen drinking alcoholic beverages. One character is seen drunk in a few scenes. Smoking is frequently shown. Multiple nude corpses are shown going up a conveyor belt into a burning pile of other dead bodies. A potentially mentally ill nazi officer fires a pistol into the pile of the corpses. Half of the movie focuses on how the Jews died during the Holocaust unexpectedly which can be really sad and emotionally intense The ending can be very emotional for some. This movie isn't particularly scary, just very distrubing, violent, and tragic. Woman and children emotionally upset and scared for their lives. The sequence of the ghetto being liquidated contains continual violence, which viewers could find emotionally disturbing. The sequence of a worker surviving an attempted execution by Amon Goeth is suspenseful. This film depicts the Holocaust and it delves deeply into the horrors of war. Because of its subject matter, it can be emotionally taxing and difficult to watch. 8 uses of f**k, 2 uses of b***h, and 1 use each of h*ll, b*****d, and p***k"

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King	PG-13	1	8	2	9	2	"Two kissing scenes at the end of the movie Two characters fight for a ring, they bite and push each other until one chokes the other to death in a scene with a slightly intense atmosphere Most violent Lord of rings movie. The film is dominated by large scale battles We see the aftermath of a battle. The battlefield is covered in dead bodies, some with spears or arrows sticking in them. We briefly see one dead man with his arm severed--we can see his arm lying next to him and his bloody stub--blood soaks the ground. The camera moves away and it is for at most a second. The enemy catapults human heads into Minas Tirith. We see somewhat closeups of the bloody heads and their severed necks. A Lord catches on fire, is engulfed in flames, and jumps off of the castle to his death. Two characters fight. They punch, kick and bite each other. One character has his finger viciously bitten off by another character. Blood runs and oozes out. In the Extended edition a man walks out of the black gate he is wearing a mask but he has cuts around his mouth and a little dried blood. A man then angrily decapitates him, we see the head roll (no blood), though we do see blood on the man's sword. A party is shown where various characters drink beer or ale, and get very drunk. A character gets so drunk he passes out. A lot of characters smoke pipes, and one character coughs once or twice as a result. Gollum's transformation in the opening scene of the film is may be unsettling and lasts two minutes, though it is not upsetting or emotionally intense. The long, violent battlefield sequences are quite scary as the heroes are always under threat of death or serious injury. A trio of characters journey through ""The Paths of the Dead"" and encounter ghosts. Frodo gets attacked by a giant spider while Sam battles against it and it's very intense (these sequences can especially frighten those who suffer from arachnophobia). The spider also moves very quickly which makes the scene all the more intense The Witch-King scenes may be frightening for some. Two of the characters descend into violent madness. The first of these is marked by a transformation into a creepy creature. That scene is particularly intense. Gollum's appearance and voice can be frightening. This is a rather violent movie but not much blood/gore is shown. It has a fantasy overtone to it. The ending of the film is emotionally intense. It is one of the most emotional scenes in motion picture history to some. 1 use of cur (extended edition only) Several uses of ""maggot""."

Pulp Fiction	R	6	12	9	3	3	Two characters talk about if a foot massage is as bad as having sex with someone's wife. Jules and Vincent shower outside. We only see them from the waist up. Butch and his girlfriend are kissing and Butch moves off-camera. Oral sex is implied. After this Butch takes a shower. He is nude, but nothing from the waist down is shown. The Gimp wears a leather suit implied to be a sex suit. But this suit isn't revealing at all. A lot of sexual references with crude, vulgar terms. Two girls are talking about piercings, one of them mentions that she has a piercing on her genitals. A man suddenly shoots another man without warning. No blood. Most violent scenes aren't that graphic. However there are a few particular parts which are. Most notably the scene in which a man is shot in the head while sitting in a car and there's a large explosion of blood and the car and people in it get covered with blood and brain matter. They later spend a scene cleaning it up. The needle scene and rape scene are also pretty brutal. A man injects heroin into his arm. It shows the needle slowly piercing and entering his skin in closeup and then as the blood fills up the syringe. This is all shown for a lengthy amount of time and might make some viewers squirm. There is a scene where a man is gagged and raped by another man. You briefly see thrusting but this is mostly offscreen, although it's still explicit and is probably the most violent scene in the movie. A man is riddled with a submachine gun. The shooting is seen very briefly, and the aftermath is shown with the man's corpse covered in blood and bullet holes, with some blood splattered on the wall. A man punches another man hard in the face, and knocking him out. A man is shot several times and screams offscreen as a result, this scene is then shown again but is onscreen, blood spurts are visible and screams are audible. A woman snorts a drug and gets a nosebleed as a result. A man chases another and shoots another man several times (but misses); he accidentally shoots an innocent woman. Blood squirts out of her leg A man is whipped in the face with the butt of a shotgun. A man is shot in the groin with a shotgun; a chunk of blood is briefly visible. He is then shown on the floor in pain. A man is sliced across the chest with a large katana (offscreen), a large streak of blood is visible, he is then killed by being stabbed in the chest. Frequent cigarette smoking. Two men have a lengthy discussion about how hash is legal in Amsterdam. A man buys heroin from his friend. He then describes how the heroin makes you high, when you use it, where it comes from and how much it costs. One man briefly smokes marijuana using a joint and a woman uses a bong. Some casual drinking. A woman uses a credit card to get some cocaine ready to snort however the use of the drug is not shown but implied. A woman goes into a bathroom and puts her head down (off camera) and we hear her snorting something (cocaine) there are several other women doing the same thing, she then pulls her head up and has a bit of cocaine underneath her nose which she wipes. Almost all of the drug use ends up backfiring against whoever uses it. The drug use though is very explicit, especially the heroin scene which is shown in extremely graphic detail and for an extended period of time. A man graphically prepares and injects heroin and a woman mistakes it for cocaine and snorts some. She collapses and nearly dies before getting an adrenaline shot to the heart. Some might find the violence in the movie disturbing or distasteful. The film's shootings and killings aren't very disturbing as they are stylized, unless you're very sensitive. Some moments in the film are played for black comedy, but they are still pretty intense. Some slurs for Koreans, Vietnamese, and Mexicans are heard in the beginning. Virtually every single character in the movie regularly uses harsh language. Samuel L Jackson's character probably says the most though. Language is used very commonly throughout, it's a part of these characters' daily conversation.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring	PG-13	1	8	5	13	0	Just 1 simple kiss for 3 seconds between a man and a woman elf. A bunch of twisted slimy dwarf skeletons. The movie begins with scenes from a vast battle, during which elves and men do battle with Sauron and his forces. The violence is more stylized than graphic. Almost no blood is seen. However, a great deal of medieval weapons are visible during this scene, and corpses are strewn all over. It looks more like they are hitting them with the swords, but there is arrow shooting. Then Sauron hits men and elves with his mace. They go flying, but there is no blood. During a one on-one fight between the leader of the men and the dark lord, the man is flung against rocks and dies with a bloody (but not gory) cut on his head. Another man then uses the sword of the fallen leader to cut off Sauron's fingers, and remove the ring. However, this is not gory, as there is fire and smoke instead of blood. Sauron then disintegrates into a pile of ashes and sends a shock wave across the field obliterating the rest of both armies. The scene in which Sauron's fingers are cut off is shown a few more times during the course of the three films. This flashback culminates with a scene in which there is some more fighting similar to the big battle. A man dives into a river and then is shot by archers. We do not see the impact, but the man is seen floating dead with several arrows protruding from his back, and some diluted blood can be seen in the water. Two elderly men fight using long sticks that emit bolts of power. They are both knocked to the ground, and flung about. By the end, they both have bloody faces. One is magically forced to rotate while lying on the floor, with his fixed head being the central point of rotation. An innocent hobbit strolling down a street has his head lopped off by a Nazgul (non-graphic). The scene cuts away on impact. One of the main characters is stabbed in the shoulder by one of the Nazgul. He screams. We see him later, near death, with a bloody wound. There is a battle in a cavern involving the heroes, orcs, and a troll. This battle is mostly non-graphic swordplay with the exception of two points. The first is when a man removes the head of an orc, and there is a small splash of black blood. The second is when the troll is shot through the mouth; again, there is little to no blood, but the arrows are shown protruding from the back of the creature's head, and from its mouth. A man is repeatedly shot with arrows. We see the impact, and he grunts in pain. He is shot three times in total. An uruk then prepares to shoot him in the head, but he is interrupted by another character. The Hobbits drink a lot of ale, and some get drunk. One scene at a bar where seveal people are drinking alcohol. Several people there are very drunk. A lot of characters smoke pipes. Gandalf and Bilbo are seen smoking pipes. When Frodo and friends go to a bar to hide from Nazgul the people that are inside are seen drinking a lot and some are getting drunk. Gandalf leans over to pick up the ring and a very sudden flash of the eye with a loud noise happens. May startle many. As the fellowship are crossing the bridge of Khazad Doom, they arrive at a part of the bridge that is in the process of crumbling, and they barely make it across before the section of bridge crumbles completely and falls down into the abyss. A quick shot of a spider and a many-legged bug when the hobbits are hiding from a ringwraith In the orc place all the orcs dig for another orc which is intense. There are a couple of jump moments. A scene in which a friendly character's face briefly turns grotesque suddenly and without warning. The change is accompanied by a loud snarl from the character, but he returns back to how he was crying. Another jump scene involves a character hiding behind a pillar, when suddenly, a much larger creature goes around the other side of the pillar and roars loudly. The Nazgul are evil creatures that are cloaked all in black, and that give off a bloodcurdling cry from time to time. The formation of Lurtz is grotesque. Some may find it disturbing. The facial appearance of the Orcs could be scary. The faces of the orcs are cut up and a little bloody with yellow eyes and gray skin. Most of the battle sequences are intense. There is one scene with a gigantic, flaming, demon-like creature, called a Balrog. An enormous squid-like creature with numerous tentacles and razor sharp teeth attacks the Fellowship. There is one brief scene in which a creature is tortured. This may be disturbing for younger viewers. The creature's screams can be heard and his hands are visible, but nothing graphic is shown. When a man is affected by the ring, he becomes irrational and gets somewhat scary, shouting and grabbing other characters. 

Forrest Gump	PG-13	9	9	7	4	8	"Jenny exposes her breasts to Forrest. No graphic nudity, we only see her bare back. The outline of jenny's nipple is briefly shown as she shows forrest her breasts. There is kissing and implied sex, Jenny and Forrest kiss in a bed, lieutenant Dan is shown making out with a woman as she sits on his lap. Jenny's butt can be seen Two characters have sex off screen, but the man's moaning sounds are heard. It's implied that a child hears the sounds, which he later mocks to the man. Jenny is briefly shown in a car with a man, and they begin to make out. Forrest (not knowing what's happening), goes to stop the man thinking he's hurting her. They go inside and Jenny shows her breasts to Forrest (it's not shown). A scene in which Jenny performs as a showgirl completely naked in a bar. However, a guitar covers her breasts and vulva, though her butt can be seen sometimes Forrest's pubic hair can be seen completely A scene with prostitutes involved. Nothing explicit but it is part of the plot. Overall not a lot of violence. 90% of the violence occurs during the Vietnam chapter, explosions, gun shots, dead bodies, etc. other than that nothing else happens except (non-graphic) punching and bullying. Some mild violence in the Vietnam scene. Some brief blood and Forrest gets shot; references to it made throughout. A man slaps Jenny and Forrest beats up people who abuse/""annoy"" Jenny. Forrest finds and saves plenty of soldiers in the jungle during the Vietnam scene, and brings them to a safe area saving them. The men have blood on them, but its usually not very bad. One of the men hurts his legs so badly to the point that they had to be amputated. Real-life footage of a man being gunned down and blood seeping through his shirt is shown for a few seconds. A prolonged scene takes place during the Vietnam War in which fighter planes drop incinerator bombs on a jungle, weapons are fired, and several men are shown being shot at and blown up; lots of gunfire, explosions, and shouting (as well as some blood) is present. The actual fighting isn't graphic, but it's violently intense and results in the death of at least one man and in the dismemberment of another man's legs; we also briefly see a bloody wound on a man's stomach and a man narrating the scene says he was shot in the buttocks (we briefly see the bullet hole on his buttock when he later shows the wound to another man). Men are later seen in a hospital, where we see men on gurneys hooked up to medical equipment and in various stages of injury, some with missing limbs; one man is briefly shown with half his face covered with a blood-stained cloth. Bullies insult, throw rocks at, and chase another boy (one rock hits him in the head and we see a little bit of blood). Later, the boy is shown older and he is again chased by bullies in a car. He manages to escape from the bullies both times, unharmed the second time. Some other more violent historical events are also shown, including newsreels of George Wallace getting shot (we see some blood) and assassination attempts on Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan. The assassinations of John F. Kennedy, Bobby Kennedy, and John Lennon are also referenced, but not shown. Several fistfights occur throughout the movie that result in bloody noses, black eyes, and other minor injuries. One such fight ensues from a man's violent reaction to a woman getting slapped across the face and knocked to the ground. The movie contains moderate drug content but nothing too explicit as the camera usually cuts off before we see the direct usage. Lt. Dan becomes an alcoholic after the war. He drinks beer constantly. One scene shows Jenny snorting coke at a party. Cigarette smoking for the time period capture. A woman is shown snorting cocaine (very briefly). It is later implied that she had just injected herself with heroin. Cigarettes are shown in an ashtray in a hotel room. One man says a woman who was kissing him tasted ""like cigarettes."" Bongs, ashtrays, bottles of pills, needles, and other drug paraphernalia are shown a couple times (we never see them being used, however). A man smokes cigarettes and drinks alcohol in several scenes. We see empty bottles of alcohol littered around his apartment. We briefly see a bottle of alcohol in a man's hand as he runs out of a house. This film is overall quite depressing The film has a fairly bittersweet ending and may leave you feeling mixed emotions. There is non-graphic war violence A war scene in Vietnam is quite violent and has gunfire, explosions, and shouting. Some bloody wounds are shown and at least one man is killed. Soldiers are later seen seriously injured, and some with missing limbs and bandaged in a hospital. A man's legs are amputated (off screen) as a result of what happened in the aforementioned Vietnam War sequence and he is for some time depicted as being bitter and depressed and as having turned to alcohol to deal with his loss. The word ""cripple"" is used offensively a few times. Goddamn is used around 20-30 times. S*** Happens Sticker Was on Someone's Car. After Forrest Gump show his Buttocks, Lyndon B Johnson Laughed and Said ""God damn Son"" I use of ""n****s"" when referring to black students The word ""Coon"" is used to describe black people Three uses of the F word, One barely heard, one said out loud, and one covered up with microphone feedback. 10 uses of the word ""shit"", one of which is in writing."

Fight Club	R	9	14	6	3	9	"Occasional sexual dialogue. References to dildos A woman references having sex with a certain person A man wakes up to hear a man and a woman having sex. Loud, passionate moaning can be heard. Nothing is shown. A woman makes some crude references Nudity includes breasts during sex in one part but it is very brief. An image of a shirtless woman is seen briefly as well. Breasts are fully visible. Moaning noises are heard coming from the theater. A brief picture of a penis is shown. A woman grabs a man's balls briefly A man is pistol whipped. Little blood is shown. Extremely brutal, bloody and disturbing fist-fighting scenes throughout. There are more than a dozen scenes of fighting between men, and the fighting can get extremely gruesome and savagely violent. A man's face is beaten to a bloody pulp. He struggles to breathe afterwards. This is extremely brutal and it's all shown in really close-up and slow-motion. A character's apartment explodes. A character dreams of being caught in a plane crash, with an inside view of an airplane being torn apart. A group of men hold a man hostage, pulling down his pants and duct-taping his mouth shut. They threaten to castrate him and he passes out from shock. A car crash happens when a character stops steering and allows the car to careen into oncoming traffic before crashing into a ditch. A man covers another man's hand with an acidic powder as a test of strength and slaps him repeatedly as he screams and writhes in pain. The skin starts to blister really bad and partly melts away. This is pretty graphic and the camera lingers on the injury for a while. Members of the ""Fight Club"" are told to start fights with strangers in public and they do so. A man shoots himself through the cheek. Lots of blood then gushes out from the wound and down his neck. Another man is seen with a graphic and gory bullet hole on the back of his head and he collapses, dead. Men commit acts of urban vandalism, such as blowing up a computer store and destroying a coffee shop. A character gets shot in the head by a police officer. He lays on a table, dead as he bleeds out from the back of his head. The top half of his head is missing and blood and brains spill out. Brief but very graphic. One character hits the other character's head from the floor, the scene is very brutal and gory, later this same character is seen in a film with a partially mutilated face. After most of the fight scenes characters have some bloody cuts and bruises. The main character often walks around with injuries that get more severe as the film goes on. A woman threatens suicide by overdosing on Xanax. A bottle of pills is seen a few times. Vodka and beer drinking. A woman smokes constantly, and appears in several scenes. One of the main characters says he doesn't smoke near the beginning of the film, but starts smoking later. Several scenes take place in and around bars. The film has a very dark tone throughout the film, although some moments are meant to be comedic. The whole film is extremely disturbing and psychologically crazy, as it depicts men engaging in acts of urban vandalism, fighting each other and doing other barbaric things in order to achieve to get their masculinity, whereas the Narrator slowly becomes increasingly insane as his inner demons begin to control him. This is all very unnerving and thought-provoking, but the film has a darkly comedic and satirical tone. MA15+ ( Strong Violence, Strong Coarse Language & Strong Adult Themes ) 80 uses of ""f--k"".

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers	PG-13	1	8	1	6	0	Two kissing scenes between a man and a woman Orcs raid and burn a village to the ground, burning buildings and killing without mercy. People flee and scream in terror. Cavalry charge an orc encampment. Several orcs are shot with arrows and stabbed. One orc is speared, but chases two characters into the woods. We see his bloody gut wound, and he limps with agony. Cavalry men charge cavalry orcs. Soldiers on both sides are stabbed, speared, decapitated and limbs are hacked off. We see bloodied swords and several bodies on the ground. Thousands of cavalry riding men charge into orcs on foot. Several orcs are killed. Characters find an orc head impaled on a spear. Humans ambush another group of humans fighting for the bad guys. Several of the bad guy humans are shot with arrows and we see several dead bodies. The orcs are shown to be cannibalistic and eat their own kind, with gross and occasionally bloody results. In the extended edition, we see the aftermath of a battle at a creek, with several, bloodied dead bodies of orcs and men on the ground, with blood in the creek. Several characters smoke pipes and drink wine and ale, though they never get drunk. In a very sad/intense scene, children go to war Evil, unsympathetic orc creatures begin eating another orc, which they just decapitated, all that is seen of the act itself is an intestine flying up in the air, it is easy to miss, however this is all still pretty disturbing Armies of orcs are grotesque, with rough voices and yellow eyes and sharp teeth. A few of them have blood dripping out of their mouths. They are very frightening. The orcs are shown in several scenes. In a scene in which the main character falls into a marsh that carries the souls of dead people, we see very scary, grotesque ghosts trying to pull him in before he is instead pulled out. This scene is disturbing and very scary. The servants of Sauron are clad all in black with their faces invisible. They emit loud screams and talk with a very evil, low voice. They ride grotesque flying creatures that kill people and good guys without mercy, mostly by picking them up and letting them fall. Gollum is a frightening, frightening creature, who is present through most of the film, though he talks and interacts with main characters. 

Inception	PG-13	3	22	2	10	4	"There is a mild kissing scene between Arthur and Ariadne. Nothing else happens. The main antagonist is wearing a revealing dress. One specific character shows a lot of cleavage by the dresses she wears throughout the movie A woman shoots a man in the leg, and another man in the room shoots her and two other men. A man runs through a crumbling building shooting several attackers in the beginning. There's a shootout in a street when a freight train plows through several cars, and a group of men fire guns at a taxi and van full of people. The people return fire and escape, ands several attackers are bloodlessly shot and killed. There's a long sequence where people raid a base in snowy mountains, and Two men fight and one is thrown off balcony, and he lands in a snowdrift and kills the other man. He proceeds to move around the base killing more men and placing charges, and he ultimately detonates them, causing a massive explosion. A man knocks another man off a snowmobile. There's a chase on a hill and several men chase other men on skis, firing guns at them, and a few men are knocked off their skis and roll down the hill, unconscious. Several men fire at an abandoned building, and people inside return fire, and one man blows up an attacker with a large grenade launcher. A woman throws herself off a ledge, but is not seen hitting the ground. There's a car chase shown intermittently in the middle of the film, where several men chase a van and fire weapons at it. Several cars crash, and the van flips over but lands right side up, and it continues driving. The van ultimately goes over the side of a bridge when more men shoot at it, and lands in water. A man fights another man in a hallway, though this is brief, and one of the men kills the other. Explosives are detonated in an elevator shaft, and a large explosion is seen. A group of people hold a woman while another woman stabs her (not graphic), though this is in a dream. A street starts violently exploding in a dream, and two people are killed (in the dream). Two men fight in a hotel room briefly. A few shootings with blood spray In a Dream a man is Shot in the leg blood Squirts out and Then he is Shot in the Head.This is fair suprisingly and very Hard to catch A man is shot about halfway through the movie, where we see red seep through a man's shirt as he coughs up flecks of blood. Blood is seen on his shirt for the rest of the film. Violence in Inception is tricky to tally. At times we see real men get hurt or killed. But much of the violence is perpetuated in dream worlds, where the people we see are not real, but manifestations of the subject's subconscious. As a result, the ""real"" body count is surprisingly low (at least for a film that wields this much intensity), while metaphysical fatalities run off the chart. A man takes out two men in a bathroom, shooting both of them dead. The mayhem is practically bloodless, and it's perpetrated with a certain, almost chilly, remove. There's a lengthy chase scene through city streets in another country, and a man being pursued hits several men, knocking them into things. They fire guns at him, but he evades the bullets and escapes in a car. Two men fight in a hallway during a very weird sequence in which the room turns. The fight ends when one of the men shoots the other (not graphic). People drink wine and beer. Intravenous drug sedatives and other mysterious concoctions are required to put people into these dreamlike states. A character has lost his ability to dream normally, and so he repeatedly hooks himself up to delve into his own haunting dream world. Inception is an intense movie. There are many deaths including a disturbing suicide, a high-stakes espionage plot that has an exceptionally intense ending and much more. Some concepts in the movie are potentially derealizing This film has an intense atmosphere throughout. The second half of the film is especially intense. A van drives off a bridge and slowly falls toward a river. In a dream, people hold a woman while another woman walks up and stabs her. She wakes up before you can see any harm done. This scene is unexpected and can frighten some. A woman shoots a man's leg to torture him. A train unexpectedly crashes into a car with people in it. A street starts exploding (in a dream). The action is intense at times. People die (see violence/gore). The concept of the dream-levels in the movie, and the fact that you might not be sure if the characters are dreaming or not, might frighten some viewers. At least 8 hells, 2 uses of ass (both used with ""hole""), 2 damns, 6 uses of ""Godamn,"" 3 uses of ""Jesus Christ,"" 2 of ""Jesus"" and ""My God"" and 1 use each of ""For God's sakes"" and ""God."" A few uses of ""hell"", two uses of ""ass"" (one being ""jackass""), one being ""asshole"" a few ""damn""s and about 5 uses of ""goddamn"", plus one middle finger. A few occasional uses of ""shit"", ""crap"" and ""piss"". There were several uses of the expletive ""goddamn""."

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back	PG	2	11	1	2	0	"Luke recovers in a medical tank, with only his privates covered. Flirting and kissing between some main characters throughout the movie. A man is seen in a creature's cave, hanging upside down with a bit of blood on his face. The creature is very briefly seen eating the gory remains of another dead creature. The creature then comes over to the man to kill him, and the man visibly cuts off its arm with his lightsaber. In the Special and subsequent edition of the film, we very briefly see the creature crying out, and a bloody stump where it was injured. A large animal used as a beast of burden keels over and dies due to freezing. Han Solo uses Luke's lightsaber to cut the animal open in order to put Luke inside to keep him from freezing to death. The animal's white fleshy muscle/fat is exposed, but there is no blood. There is a large battle scene near the beginning of the film, where several uniformed combatants are killed onscreen, or are implied to have been killed. In the battle, there are three instances of a laser-firing, gigantic, robotic, elephant-like walking craft (an AT-AT ""walker"") being brought down and exploding into a fireball, killing its inhabitants. A pilot's wingman is shot dead by a laser blast from inside their fighter craft. He slumps forward, dead. When the fighter is shot down and crashes, an AT-AT ""walker"" steps on the remains of the ship, including the dead wingman, while the pilot barley escapes before the ship is crushed. The back of a man's horribly scarred head (enough to be bald) is briefly shown. There are two instances whereby Darth Vader telekinetically chokes a man to death. There is no blood, but we see them moan and struggle to breath until they slump over and die. Intense. Upon seeing Darth Vader in the dining hall in Cloud City, Han draws his laser gun and shoots at him, but Vader telekinetically draws the laser bolts to his own hand, using the Force to block/deflect them, before telekinetically pulling the gun out of the man's hand. Han is tortured offscreen, though the very first bits of the treatment (the man being placed face-first into a sparking electric device) are depicted. We hear audible screams from the outside of the closed doorway to the torture room. Han is frozen in a block of a dull-colored metallic substance, and this block is pushed to the floor. The frontal part of the man's figure, especially man's face and hands, while appearing coated in the same substance as the block, can be seen protruding from it. Not violent but intense. Not gory but ugly/horrifying. A number of Imperial stormtroopers are briefly shot with lasers. There is also a scene where Chewbacca knocks a few stormtroopers off a ledge. Chewbacca chokes Lando out of anger and frustration. We see the man strangling and trying to breath. He eventually releases the character. Some implied alcohol use in the Cloud City sequences. In the remastered version, there is a potential jump-scare involving the creature. Even the creature's actions can be quite scary as it happens so fast. In another scene, Luke goes into a dark cave where strange animal sounds are heard. He then has a slow motion lightsaber encounter with Darth Vader where he cuts off Vader's head and then sees his own face in the helmet, symbolizing his danger of being corrupted by the dark side of the Force. "

The Matrix	R	3	18	6	4	2	"A computer program meant to be distracting takes the form of an attractive woman in a form-fitting red dress. After Neo encounters her, one of his shipmates says he can arrange a more personal experience with her, at which point someone jokingly refers to him as a ""digital pimp"". just two kissing scenes Scene takes place in a sex club. There are many people in the background in fetish wear. Some female breast nudity but not in focus. The violence is moderate in impact with mostly bloodless shootouts and stylized martial arts combat that result in little to no blood. An Agent is shot in the head by Trinity. There is no blood/gore An Agent is Shot in the Head. Little blood Lots of killings with machine guns, resulting in numerous bodies and little blood. There are gunshot wounds on the chests and on the backs of a few people. One man gets zapped by a laser gun and we see his charred, bloody arm. There are numerous martial arts fights with lots of punching and hitting. A few more intense scenes have closeups of people being punched with blood around their mouths. Some people get their bodies slammed against walls. Not very brutal. A man has a creature extracted from his navel, no blood is shown. Trinity throws a knife into a man's forehead during an action scene, but we don't see any blood, nor do we clearly see the impact. An agent is shot at an extremely close range; we don't see the impact in detail but there is a brief red mist. A man is shot by a lot of bullets. You briefly see the the impact. Neo shoots a few people at a security gate. When people die in the matrix, their bodies in the real world cough up blood and die as well. A couple of people are killed with a laser gun, we don't see much detail. A woman beats another man up, she face-palms him and kicks him. She dodges bullets discharged by other cops, throws a chair at one of them, shoots another, then chops/kicks the final one to the ground. It is assumed all those cops die. She flees from more cops, jumping off rooftops and crashing through windows, and runs to a pay phone in order to get out of the situation. A garbage truck plows down the phone booth but she lives. There is a closeup of Morpheus being shot in the leg with a tiny bit of blood spray. Not too graphic. A group of police officers viciously beat Morpheus and he is seen covered in dust and has blood on his face. Morpheus and Agent Smith fight briefly. Morpheus gets punched several times. Blood is seen around his mouth. Mescaline is mentioned When tasked with choosing between reality or The Matrix's simulation of reality, Neo is offered two pills by Morpheus. One pill will take Neo back to his normal life in The Matrix, while the other will reveal to Neo the actual reality of The Matrix. Choi smokes a cigarette at the club, Dujour is seen with a drink. Cypher and Neo share a drink that is implied to be alcoholic based on Neo's aversive reaction. Cypher and Agent Smith have wine at dinner. Cypher also smokes a cigar. The Oracle smokes a cigarette. Although the violence is glamourized, it mostly has a very light tone and is not disturbing. Neo tries to escape from the FBI by climbing out of a window and walking on a very narrow ledge. He freaks out when the wind picks up, he goes back inside, and gets arrested. We see the cops put him in a car. Arguably the most disturbing scene in the movie, Neo gets arrested and is taken into an interrogation room where his mouth becomes sealed and then a robotic ""bug"" resembling a shrimp enters his body through his navel, it is disturbing and scary. Later this ""bug"" is extracted by a machine. This scene and where the ""bug"" is put into Neo. A traitor kills two of his crew mates by unplugging their heads from a computer, where their minds are. The crew mates look worried, and then they collapse dead on the ground. No blood whatsoever, but is intense. The songs in the end credits have some uses of the f bomb. All words are used alone or in combination with other words. 18 uses of shit, 6 hell, 5 damn 3 ass 1 dick, shut up, crap."

Se7en	R	6	5	2	3	2	"Several references to sex are covered during the movie. A photo of a man, wearing a strap-on with a large sharp blade (where his penis would be). This photo is shown twice. Two characters kiss while in bed. This is brief and not sexual. A character says ""masturbating."" Lust is one of the 7 deadly sins utilized by the killer. Towards the beginning of the movie, a dead obese man is seen on an autopsy table. His genitals can be briefly seen for about two seconds. Torture is discussed but it is never shown. Also, the aftermath of killings is shown. Although all the violence is offscreen, its description is sometimes brutal. We mostly only see and hear about the aftermath of the kills throughout the film. The violent act in which these victims are killed is not shown. The detective work displays the aftermath of the victims in a grim and gruesome way either on location, in pictures or both. Some of these scenes can be disturbing. A man is found lying on the floor of his apartment dead underneath a pool of blood. People are seen smoking and drinking. Wine is shown during a dinner table scene The film has an exceptionally dark theme, story and tone. The film is sometimes very dark and disturbing in terms of violence with various murders related to the thematics of the seven deadly sins None of the murders are shown but you see the aftermath of some of them and it is very brutal. When nothing is shown it is also very disturbing. Most of the swearing happens in the second half of the movie. 74 uses of ""fuck""."

It's a Wonderful Life	PG	7	5	4	5	2	"Some passionate kissings. Some kissing. A woman jokes to her mother that a suitor is ""making violent love to me."" A woman loses her robe while walking home, leaving her naked. She hides behind a bush and we do not see anything, but the man she's with refuses to return the robe and jokes about selling tickets to see her naked. Some men approvingly ogle a pretty woman as she walks down the street. The Violet Bicknell character flirts frequently with George Bailey. In the Pottersville, there are signs for nightclubs and burlesque theaters. A man shouts at his children and begins smashing up his house in front of them. The children are seen to be clearly distressed. A man slaps a boy repeatedly in the ears until they bleed. However, the blood cannot be seen clearly since the film is in black and white. A police officer fires a gun at an unarmed fleeing man, but the shots miss and the man escapes. A man punches another man. A man's mouth bleeds (no blood shown). Several characters smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol. Scenes of raucous drinking at a bar. George Bailey () gets drunk. An alcoholic is shown drunk A man jumps into a river to save another man from drowning. A man says horrible things to his family in a rude and mad tone, such as asking his wife why they had to have kids. The ending can be very bittersweet for viewers. A child almost drowns. The subject matters can be intense/emotional. 1 use of oh gosh, stupid, fool, creep and idiot 2 uses of moron None; just some minced oaths (curse-substitutes like Gosh)."

City of God	R	8	12	3	5	1	"Pretty mild for 2021's standards. Some nudity but not graphic at all. A man is described as a ""rapist"" Though this is never seen or talked about again. Two guys walk into a motel and open up each room to see tangled bodies very actively engaging in intercourse. Sensitive parts are most obscured by the entanglement of limbs, but we do see an extended shot of a man's butt as he thrusts on top of a woman. Lots of themes of sexuality, lots of sex talk, and aspirations to lose one's virginity, to rape, and to get laid. Two different scenes where guys are completely naked other than their hands slightly covering their genitals. We see pubic hair and lots of side butt, but they manage to hide the rest. We hear a woman recount an extremely graphic sex act that involves anal and using bananas. We then cut to see a banana and active, writhing nude bodies blurred behind it. A bare chested man gets out of bed. Not graphic. A scene in a hotel where a woman's butt is seen extremely briefly. Blink and you'll miss it. Many storeowners/banks are robbed during the movie. All the victims are threatened to obey commands from the robbers. Fast cuts of chickens being cleaned as part of food preparation. Incisions on and innards of dead birds shown interspersed with footage of living stock. No slaughter (killing) shown Adults and children brandishing firearms almost non-stop. Gangs of children and teens openly carry firearms in the streets. Many shootings, most of them involving minors and young people as victims and/or shooters. They tend to be brief or bloodless, however A young man becomes upset and starts to put his hands on his girlfriend while they argue about their relationship. No striking or shoving, the tension defuses quickly. Armed robbery of a hotel There's scenes of murder in this film. But they aren't extremely graphic and just like a normal action movie. A character is shot multiple times. His bullet-riddled body in a pool of blood is shown for over 10 seconds A young boy is forced to single out and kill another boy, using a gun. A scene of public hazing/abuse of a man under threat of a firearm. See: Sex & Nudity. Major shoot-out in a public street at night, with many automatic weapons fired and several innocent bystander casualties sustained in the surrounding community. Survivors shown sobbing over the fallen. Several dead bodies are visible. Mild to moderately bloody, but with dark camera angles at night and little actual gore shown Some brief, bloodless beatings. A few of which occur offscreen. Lil' Ze constantly sells and snorts cocaine. Numerous characters (Including children) are seen casually smoking joints or asking for them. Cocaine is snorted a few times Characters are sometimes seen handling, discussing, using, packaging or selling either marijuana or cocaine A violent film due to it's setting, characters and whole story. Corpses of many dead bodies are shown in the movie. A little kid is seen shooting and killings some people while he smiles. This scene is disturbing. MA15+ ( Strong Violence, Strong Adult Themes, Coarse Language & Drug Use ) The foot-shooting and shovel-killing scenes could be hard to watch. A sympathetic character is shot in the torso. 64 uses of ""fuck"", 18 uses of ""shit"", 7 uses of ""asshole"", a few uses of ""bitch"", 3 uses of ""hell"", A few of ""Christ"", ""God"", and ""Jesus"", 3 uses of ""faggot"", 4 uses of ""damn"", 3 uses of ""nigger"", 1 use of ""slut"", ""whore"", and ""prick"".

Saving Private Ryan	R	3	18	3	5	1	"Soldiers talk about women back in the U.S. A Soldier makes a sexual reference to another soldier and says; ""I thought you liked it in the a*s?"" Private Ryan tells a story back to when he and his brothers caught their oldest brother trying to have sex with a girl in their barn. A soldier is briefly shown with his intestines hanging out of his stomach. Very graphic and possibly the most brutal scene in the entire film. Many people are blown up. Sometimes there is gore but other times theres none. A Flak gun is used against an American infantry unit, killing them. Just after the camera cuts to a different angle, a tank crew man is shot in the face at point-blank range. Some blood that sprays out from the headshot can be seen. A bomb blows up prematurely in a soldiers hands, killing him instantly. Intense and bloody. Chunks of blood spray and spurt. A nazi is shot through a wall by a machine gun. Blood sprays onto a wall and is seen for the rest of the movie. We hear a thud and see a puddle of blood form on the ground. A soldier is shot in the throat. Blood squirts and dribbles from his mouth. Blood puddles beneath his body. This scene is brutal. A medic tends to a soldier that has a very graphic wound on his shoulder. Blood is shown and he is yelling and wincing. Several nazis are intensely gunned down by a squad of soldiers inside of a kitchen. Blood and smoke are everywhere. One nazi has blood drooling out of his mouth. Several scenes with charred up dead bodies shown throughout the movie. There is a very intense event in which a young solder without an arm, seems to calmly (due to shock) pick up his recently dismembered arm and walks away. An American sniper shoots a Nazi sniper right through the scope into his eye. The bullet goes through the entire head (we very briefly see his gory eye socket and bits of matter spray) and stains the wall behind the nazi with blood. Graphic. Two soldiers (who are Czech) are clearly attempting to surrender with their hands in the air but are shot by US soldiers and then mocked (""Look, I washed for supper""). A soldier is briefly seen headless. Intense war violence throughout (especially in the first 20 minutes). All of it is realistic, but like a lot of other live-action war movies, it's meant to portray how awful war is. This is definitely the darkest DreamWorks movie, ahead of Artificial Intelligence. That's saying a lot. Strong violence through out the whole movie. In the begging scene where they storm the beach you see dozens of men get brutally killed and shot up Left to right The first 27 minutes of the film depict soldiers landing on Omaha beach in Normandy. This is the most graphic and intense part of the film, and the sequence contains bloody, graphic violence, which can be disturbing. During the sequence many soldiers are shot with bloody results, people have their limbs shot off, people are burned etc. At the end of the landing sequence the beach is littered with corpses, and the ocean is tinted red. Very strong bloody and graphic violence throughout. The film features prolonged extreme war violence with dismemberment, soldiers engulfed in flames and other intense images. The depiction of war violence remains consistent throughout the film, with hand-to-hand combat, sniper fire, and other inherently violent depictions of war fighting. Morphine is used to sedate a wounded soldier. Characters often smoke cigarettes one character chews chewing tobacco Scenes show the use of tobacco products, but no illegal substances. The entire film has extremely intense, graphic, bloody and chaotic battle sequences that are very brutal and violent. A man is seen picking up his own arm and walking off, one of the darkest scenes of the movie. Intense and realistically gory war violence throughout (especially in the first 20 minutes), but like a lot of other live-action war movies from the mid-90's and on (when they perfected gory special effects), it's meant to portray what war is actually like in real life, and to discourage war. It can also be portrayed as educational to the military if a war does start, though. The battle sequences throughout the film are intense both sensually and emotionally. The opening and closing sequences feature realistic war-fighting, loud gunfire, booming explosions, hand-to-hand combat, intense depictions of death and sequences of soldiers succumbing to their wounds. The intense battle sequences make the viewer immersed by means of handheld cameras, and getting close to the action, to a point where there is frequently blood or rain water on the lens of camera. The first war scene is truly very violent. It is about 20 minutes long. You can't get any more realistic than that scene. Lots of people die. Heads get blown off, bodies explode, and people get stabbed. 19 uses of ""fuck"", 15 uses of ""shit"", 1 use of ""cocksucker"", and some uses of ""goddamn"", son of a bitch"", ""prick"", and ""asshole"""

Life Is Beautiful	PG-13	3	3	3	1	1	"A man carries a sleeping child and while the child is sleeping, and clearly doesn't hear him, the man tells the child that he wants to find his wife and ""make love to her... over and over."" No nudity or onscreen sex. One character repeatedly tells the woman with whom he is in love that he wants to make love to her in one scene. One character refers to a brothel during a conversation with another man. A man on a bike falls on a woman. They don't get hurt. Guns are present in the film. Not used for gunfire. A man puts his hat on and eggs inside the hat cracks on his head. Very comedic. Wine is served with several meals throughout the film, and guests at a party drink champagne. There is no drunkenness or abuse of alcohol in the film. One of the supporting actors smokes at a party. A few of the soldiers may be shown smoking in the background, but none of the main characters use tobacco products. There is no drug use or abuse in this film. The first half of the film is completely free from frightening/intense scenes. Due to the main character's determination to make his son believe that they are simply playing a ""game,"" and are, in fact, there willingly, many scenes that might otherwise be frightening/intense are made humorous, poignant, and/or bittersweet. Toward the end of the film, the main character tries to free his wife and sneaks through the camp in order to do so. Fairly light, some uses of damn and one use of jackass"

Interstellar	PG-13	2	3	2	3	6	"Two characters kiss. It's brief and takes place during the final act of the film. Some brief scientific discussions about repopulation, but nothing graphic. A character is killed in a explosion, no blood, the building just blows up. A man is punched in the face. One man grabs a tire iron in preparation of fighting another man, but the conflict never occurs. Two men drink out of beer bottles. Alcohol is briefly sipped at a meeting. Extremely intense and emotional film, dealing with the extinction of mankind itself. It depicts a future Earth that suffers huge dust storms and is running out of food. It is implied billions have died. An action scene involving astronauts attempting to evade a giant tidal wave is intense. The threat of being stranded in space and humanity becoming extinct hangs over the characters. '*ss' is said four times, including one paired with 'hole'. 'Son of a b*tch' is said once. 'Godd*mn' is said once. ""Jesus"" is blasphemed early on in the movie. 'F*ck' is said twice, although one is almost inaudible. 'Sh*t' is said seven times, including one paired with 'bull'."

The Green Mile	R	6	11	3	3	5	"A couple is having sex but you don't see them but you hear moaning from the wife. Later, you see the husband on top of his wife (after implied sex). There is a death row inmate convicted of rape. A man has a book in front of him but he's not reading a book, instead he is looking at a porn booklet that shows a cartoon-drawn woman and man, having sex. A prisoner named Bill, makes sexual comments or references. Bare male buttocks can briefly be seen Two different characters in different scenes grab on to ones character's penis. First one isn't done sexually. The second one can be viewed sexually by the way he's touching/holding it. No nudity. In the botched execution scene violence is actually quite tame, however it is still very disturbing. In this scene there is no visible blood. Quite a few executions by electric chair. One is botched. A prisoner attempts to kill a prison guard by strangulation. He kicks other guards in the process. One guard intervenes before the inmate kills anyone. Another prisoner is executed, but due to a purposefully botched setup, the man is zapped for a long time, his body convulsing from the electricity and flames breaking out on his body and under his death hood as he screams (this goes on for what seems like several minutes). A man cradles the dead bodies of two girls; their hair is matted with blood. The father bloodlessly punches him across the face a few times in despair before he is pulled away. An antagonist is shot five times in the chest, some blood and bullet wounds appear on his shirt as he slumps down dead. A prisoner elbows one guard and chokes another with handcuffs (a bit of blood spurts from his mouth) before bashing his head on the wall, a bit of blood is on their faces. He then kicks an incoming guard in the crotch before another one hits the prisoner twice, knocking him out. A mouse is purposely smashed by a shoe, we see some blood around its head/face. We see a bit of blood on a door and a small blood trail on a floor. An antagonist hits a prisoner once on the fingers with a billy club, it's later brought up that three of them were broken as a result. A few punches and a slap or two from angry guards towards an antagonist. The guards are shown drinking at one point in the film. One or two brief instances of smoking. Paul and Hal have what may be beer while grilling some food. The guards grind up some sort of medication/pills that they put in Wild Bill's beverage to knock him out. The first execution, while not as violently prolonged as the second, could still be hard to watch due to its realism. An antagonist attacks some guards early on. In two scenes, a protagonist is shown to be in pain while urinating. The kidnap, rape, and murder of two little girls play a role in the plot. The rape and murder are not shown. However, the kidnapping -- which is carried out via manipulating the girls rather than by brute force -- is shown. 12 uses of f##k Words like f**k, a**hole, d*ck, and sh*t are used throughout the movie. During an execution rehearsal, a man uses the words sh*t and mother****er in his ""last words"". Multiple uses of blasphemy (Jesus/Christ/God) 1 use of the N word."

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope	PG	0	8	1	2	1	 (At around 1 h 30 min) Obi-Wan allows himself to be killed during a duel.

Throughout this time, Han has covertly drawn his own laser gun and, from his waist, obscuredly aimed it at Greedo. This is suspenseful. In the original version of the film, just as Greedo about make good on his aggressive words, space above the table explodes into a momentary cloud of smoke, and the alien's dead body is shown slumping forward onto the table, as he had been shot by Han. Whereas in Special and subsequent editions of the film, Greedo is shown to fire at but miss Han's head before being immediately shot dead by Han's return fire. There are numerous scenes of gunplay, all of which leave no visible wounds. (at around 1 h 54 min) A massive space station ignites into an enormous shock wave and explosion that kills all lifeforms on board. There is a scene early on in the film set at a bar. Numerous characters are drinking unidentified beverages, presumed to be alcoholic. One character in the scene is seen smoking a hookah, and another appears to be smoking a cigarette on a holder. (At around 50 min) Han Solo's fight scene in the bar leaves a smoking husk of alien on a table. In the final battle's trench run, Luke's wingmen are killed or forced to disengage one by one by Darth Vader pursuing and shooting them. 1 use of hell and 2 uses of damn

Terminator 2: Judgment Day	R	4	17	4	6	4	"When the second terminator comes you can briefly see his buttocks and testicles, but nothing prolonged though. A guard licks Sarah's face when he thinks she's asleep A tavern waitress is aroused by a nude T-800; her sexually suggestive reaction is only visible through the Terminator's point of view. No explicit nudity shown. Sara's nipples can be seen through her white shirt during the prison scene. The T-1000 turns his finger into a needle and stabs a police officer through his eye. Little blood is shown. Near the beginning of the film, two orderlies tase Sarah for several seconds with a stun gun and force pills down her throat. Not lengthy or graphic but can be disturbing for some. The Terminator throws a biker into a bar's kitchen. The biker lands on a large grill and is briefly burned before falling off. During the future war scene, many soldiers are shot by lasers on machines. (Not graphic.) A man puts out his cigar on the Terminator's shoulder. The Terminator then crushes the man's hand in its grip. The T-1000 kills a police officer and takes his clothes and his squad car. The Terminator and T-1000 shoot at each other in a hallway. An innocent bystander is gunned down in the crossfire. They then struggle and crash through a wall, and one is thrown through a window. The T-1000 (disguised as John's foster mother) transforms his arm into a sword-like weapon and impales John's foster father through his head while drinking from a milk carton. ""She"" then pulls it out and the man's corpse falls to the ground. Some blood, mixed with milk. The T-1000 kills a dog and rips off it's collar, blood is seen on the collar (uncut version only). An orderly at a mental institute is hit across the face by a broom handle. Blood spurts. Sarah sneaks up on a man and a guard and repeatedly whacks the guard with a baton before breaking the man's arm with it and hitting him on the back of the knees, so he falls. Sarah Connor puts a syringe on Silberman's neck that is filled with poison. She does not empty the poison into him though. T-101 shoots an officer twice in his legs. Impact shots are seen and he screams in pain. When a group of male nurses hold Sarah down and attempt to inject her, the Terminator grabs one man and throws him into a window, smashing it. He then picks up another and throws him through a glass door. A third man runs at him with his baton and tries to hit him but the Terminator hits him in the stomach with his rifle and throws him away, he hits a wall very hard and bounces off. Sarah dreams about a nuclear attack and a large nuclear weapon detonates over a city. We see many children and their mothers burning and screaming. Sarah then catches on fire and screams horribly. Later, when the blast comes, the carbonized bodies of the women and children disintegrate and Sarah screams as her flesh is ripped off. The Terminator cuts the skin off his arm and rips it away to reveal his metal skeleton. Graphic. At Cyberdyne, Dyson is shot several times with blood spurts. People are seen drinking alcohol in a bar. Sarah is physically forced by male nurses to take her medication that she refuses. A man in a bar is smoking a cigar. Sarah Connor is shown smoking a cigarette in a couple scenes. The T-1000 morphs out of the floors, and stabs a jovial security guard through the eye. The security guard shakes in tremulous pain, and dies as the T-1000 observes his movements in interest. M12+ ( Frequent Violence & Coarse Language ) Some intense (and often one-sided) fights. Two guards force Sarah in a mental institute to take her meds by beating and shocking her. (uncut version only) A dog is killed, which may upset some animal lovers (uncut version only). The Terminator cuts the skin off his arm and rips it away to show Dyson his metallic arm. Blood and flesh is on his metal arm.

Frequent uses of ""shit"" are also present. ""Ass"", ""damn"", ""hell"", ""dick"", ""bitch"", and ""bastard"" are also used."

Spirited Away	PG	5	4	5	6	3	"Radish spirit creature that Chihiro meets in the elevator is wearing a loin cloth and no top, their nipples are visible A girl and a woman are shown with backless tops. As two characters fly fast and low to the ground, some women's robes are blown up as they make surprised noises. Nothing is shown. A giant baby wears an open-back outfit. Brief cleavage is present in the film. Haku (dragon form) is chased by paper birds who cut him. His blood splatters everywhere in the room (over the walls, etc). His mouth also bleeds. The scene is quite long. The sound of blood being spat out is heard. Kamaji tells Sen that Haku is bleeding internally and she has to stick her arm in his mouth to give him medicine. He has sharp teeth and she nearly gets bitten by him. No-Face at one point goes on a rampage and eats people, but they are later spat out and revealed to be unharmed. He also vomits violently at different points, and is greedy and gluttonous. A monster is made of many dirty substances. When Sen/Chihiro rips a fishing rod's lure & hook out of the monster, blood and mucus pour out of the hole. Yubaba tells Haku ""I get to give Sen one final test, if she fails, she's mine"" (meaning she'll kill her). One character smokes a cigarette; a character has an ash tray with cigarettes in it. A character is seen opening a window and smoking a cigarette. One character tells a customer that he can buy sake. After bathing the polluted river spirit, Yubaba sees the money Sen has made and triumphantly shouts, ""Sake's on the house tonight!"" Sen gives Haku a drug-like ball of what appears to be dirt or mud. The film is mostly comforting and heart-warming whilst it is bizarre and unsettling. Some spirits are quite strange looking. Chihiro's parents are turned into pigs. The scene in which Haku is attacked by paper birds can be rather intense. The overall theme is very dark, involving a young girl who is alone, facing the loss of both parents, and is in near constant peril. Also the main character is a child (10-years old) is being imprisoned for most of the movie in a strange ghost world. This is a very scary thought. Yubaba threatens to rip Sen's mouth off. A man dances around singing, ""welcome the rich man, he's hard for you to miss, his butt keeps getting bigger so there's plenty there to kiss!"" Many characters frequently make fun of Chihiro/Sen for being a human, telling her that she smells bad and that she's lazy and stupid. Lin frequently calls her ""dope"" which starts out as being rude, but then it just becomes a teasing nickname and they become close friends."

The Pianist	R	1	28	1	12	2	"Statue of nude woman. Man in bath tub is shown; nudity is limited to his bare chest. A young boy tries to crawl under a stone wall, he gets half way through, is grabbed from the other side and is beaten to death (we see him struggling and hear him crying out and then he goes limp). A man in a wheelchair is shoved off a balcony and we watch him crash onto the street below. A woman is shot in the head, men are forced to lie face down on the street and are shot one-by-one in the head (blood pours from the wounds). People run into the streets and are gunned down, we see them fall, see blood on their clothing and watch as a truck drives over their bodies (one man was still alive before he was run over). A man and a woman run through a street, the woman is shot and she falls to her knees. We see many dead bodies littering a desolate, rubble covered street (women and children with pools of blood around their heads), we see a few dead bodies lying near a train track, and we see dead bodies slumped against a blood splattered wall. A man is whipped on the back until he falls unconscious and dragged through the mud, and a line of men is whipped by a drunken officer. A soldier is shot as he and others march through a street; guns are fired from the street into a building and the people inside shoot back, fires break out inside the building and we see people jumping out of windows in flames and hear them hit the ground; others are brought out of the building, lined up and shot. Soldiers are shot by civilians, grenades are thrown into a building, and we see puddles of blood on the ground and the building burns. A tank takes aim and fires on a building where a man is hiding, he runs to the roof, he is shot at by men in a building in the distance, and as the man runs through the building again he passes a dead man in a stairwell who is burned and tattered. We see people being shot in a street and dead bodies strewn around, and a man who's pursued lies among them pretending to be dead, as soldiers march by. A flame thrower is used in a building where a man is hiding: he runs, jumps from a low window, hurts his leg, limps away and hides in an attic in a building. A man is shot at by soldiers and they hold him at gunpoint. A pile of dead bodies is set on fire (we see them engulfed in flames and then charred and smoldering). A young boy cries over his father's dead body, and we see a dead body on the street with an exposed bloody leg bone. People walk past a dead body on the street and two men push a cart full of dead bodies. A man is beaten with a stick, a man is beaten with a gun butt, a man is punched in the nose and he bleeds, and a man is punched in the face (he falls to the ground, gets up and is forced to walk in the gutter rather than on the sidewalk). We hear a gunshot and a woman screams. Soldiers barge into a building, punch a man, go into an apartment, we hear yelling and watch as a man is surrounded by the soldiers. Lines of wounded people walk through a street, followed by soldiers with guns. We see horse carcasses in a street after a bombing. People are collected, packed onto train cars, the doors are closed and locked and we hear them screaming. Soldiers are collected and locked in a pen and are berated by other men walking by. A man appears very ill and we hear that he has had no nourishment for some time. Soldiers march through rubble strewn streets in a few scenes, while civilians watch in fear. Bombs drop and explode outside a building, windows break, a roof falls in while people inside the building run and dodge the debris, and one man is hit in the head and we see some blood. We hear that people are being hunted down in the streets. As a train full of people pulls away, a man says, ""...off they go to the melting pot,"" a man talks about people being hanged for helping Jews, and two men talk about extermination. People smoke cigarettes and drink alcohol. Many deaths are seen, including children. The movie is very realistic with this showing blood around children's bodies and wounds. Much of the first part of the film is focused on the brutal living conditions faced by the Jewish people in Poland during WWII. There are many disturbing, violent scenes throughout, but the majority are in the first half or so. Scenes involving a child being beaten to death and an entire family executed in the street are especially intense. We watch the degradation of people who are forced to wear arm bands so as to be ethnically labeled, they are forced to leave their homes and belongings, families are separated and we hear that if they do not do as they are ordered they will be severely punished. There are several battle scenes and frequent explosions, and an intense scene involving flamethrowers. The overall tone of the film is dark and the violence is realistic and hard-hitting. Starvation is depicted throughout. Since the film takes place in the holocaust it is a very hard and sad film to see. A woman goes mad after having smothered her child while trying to keep it from crying (she moans/cries in regret and repeats ""why did I do it"" aloud to herself). The smothering is not shown, the story of it happening is told from a third party while she cries in the background. A woman begs for water for her unconscious child. An elderly man is forced to dance to keep warm, then others gathered around him are forced to dance with him, and one man with a cane falls to the ground. There is more than one use of fuck and they are all said by the Russians. 5 scatological terms, 3 mild obscenities, 4 religious exclamations."

Parasite	R	7	3	5	5	2	"A married couple engages in heavy petting, with the woman's breast briefly visible, nipple is not shown. Takes place in a living room with hidden people nearby, listening and aware of the sex play. A woman wearing a dress takes off her underwear in the backseat of a car. No nudity is seen. A man grabs a woman's butt briefly. A man and woman lying together on a couch begin touching each other. No nudity is seen, the scene is tame, only lasting a minute or two. There is some talk about sex in a couple scenes but nothing too explicit Ki-Woo and Da-Hye kiss in a couple scenes. One very passionate kissing scene. No nudity Mild to Moderate - No nudity or sex scenes in the entire film. However, some heavy kissing, sexual references and sexual play are shown in the film, awkward and not graphic. The movie is violent towards the end. Gore wise there are a few scenes with some blood, but nothing very graphic. The violence is almost all in the last third of the film. Three characters are killed by stabbing. Blood is shown. During a flood, a young woman smokes a cigarette while sitting on an overflowing toilet. Characters are shown drunk. While role playing, a woman asks her husband to buy her drugs. This is talk about firing someone from their job as it is theorized that the worker was using drugs in their bosses car. The scene is comedic. There is use of cigarets, drug references and alcohol use, but drugs are not a theme at all. Although it has humor in it, Parasite has a dark tone and some frightening moments. The ""ghost"" scene contains briefly frightening imagery. The film is generally based on the differences of poor to wealthy groups of people. A few scenes in the film are extremely intense and frightening. The final confrontation is extremely tense and scary. There is some unexpected violence that may frighten viewers, it's not intense and is only towards the end. There is mild profanity throughout, however ""Fuck"" is said a couple dozen times in the subbed version. Fuck is shown on the subtitles for non Korean speakers, other than that the profanity is very mild."

Léon: The Professional	R	5	6	3	5	3	"A 12 year old girl develops a crush on the main character throughout the film and makes a couple references, but they aren't anything close to explicit. A man squeezes his wife's breast and they start kissing. Their daughter walks in on them before anything remotely explicit or inappropriate is shown. A 12 year old girl is attracted to an older man and she will constantly refer to this jokingly. Nothing inappropriate is ever done and nothing happens between them. A naked woman Is killed (she Is covered by the water) but when she Is shot to death full side nudity Is seen. Implied sex with a prostitute, nothing heard, woman is seen with sheet over body after. The violence is pretty graphic, but the film focuses more on the drama than the action. So, it's pretty infrequent. A man pulls someone off of a balcony and you hear him scream as he falls to his death. A man shoots someone. While you do not see the bullet hit, you do see some blood on a nearby wall. A man shoots a girl with a shotgun (not graphic) but you do see a bloody wound for a second. A small boy is shot dead. This is not shown, however it is discussed heavily throughout the film and you see the killer trying to shoot the boy. This scene is extremely intense. A man walks into a room and shoots two people with considerable blood spray. Stansfield takes some kind of psychoactive pill twice during the film; he also lights up a cigarette in one scene. Tony is shown drinking several times at his bar. A 12-year-old girl smokes and drinks throughout the film. The main antagonist is a psychopathic and violent dirty cop. He may be disturbing to some. Rated R: Strong bloody graphic violence, some drug content and for language. Themes of dirty cops and a small girl training to be an assassin may upset some people. There is a rather long scene where an entire family with young children is executed one by one. There is also an undercurrent of sexual tension between a pre-adolescent girl and a much older man. This is dealt with in more verbal detail (Leon refused Mathilda's advances and they discuss the appropriateness of their relationship) in the extended ""Version Longue"". ""Fuck"" is said 15-20 times ""Christ"" and ""Jesus"" are abused. 1-G*d da*n"

Gladiator	R	5	10	1	1	3	Djimon Honsou's glutes are seen. Near the end of the movie, Commodus bend down to his sister lying down the bed. Inches close of an incestuous kiss, he blackouts. Male characters are frequently shown shirtless or bare-chested throughout the film. During an arena battle, a female archer can be seen wearing form-fitted armor complete with nipples. It is not explicit, and can only be seen in a few quick shots. No nudity in the movie. Only some references A man treats a graphic wound on his body, which we see up close and for several seconds. Although most of the violence in this movie is quite brief, it is still pretty graphic and highly realistic. There is a lot of violence in this movie, quite often including a flash of blood, however most of it is very brief The first arena battle includes a spiked ball on a chain getting smashed into someone's face. It is very brief, but there is a large blood spurt. This is by far the most violent scene in the movie. Multiple scenes showing bloody violence, much of it in brief shots. There is a rather bloody battle near the beginning (as well as a couple other shorter ones), and a few bloody arena battles. Men are killed with blows and dull objects, and stabbed with swords, knives, and spears (often with brief blood). There are a few brief instances of dismemberment and couple of decapitation, we usually see a flash of red. An opponent is also cut in half by blades on a chariot's wheel during combat; violent, but brief. An attacking tiger is stabbed with a sword, no blood is shown. A man slices off a tattoo on his upper arm, with a bit of bleeding. There are a few scenes with the infrequent drinking of beverages that may or may not be alcoholic in nature. Some pretty intense fights (gladiatorial or otherwise), and a violent escape. Two uses of whore 1 use of shithole A few insults, and one use of 'shit'.

American History X	R	4	9	5	5	2	"The movie begins with the main character having sex with his girlfriend. You see thrusting and bare breasts briefly. The only nudity in this movie are some male buttocks in the shower and bare breasts briefly in the sex scene The main character gets raped in prison while taking a shower. Brief male genitalia and buttocks are shown in the shower scenes, which take place in a prison. Very brief, non-sexual. The violence is in no way glorified. A man gets elbowed in the face during a basketball game. Blood is seen on the ground. Later he spits out a lot of blood. Two brothers briefly get into a little scuffle. Violence in this movie isn't too frequent. The curb bite scene is the most brutal scene but we dont see anything. A gang of white supremacists rob and terrorize a grocery store that employs minorities, hitting and kicking various individuals multiple times onscreen. A group of black teens kick a caucasian teen twice in the chest before they are stopped. A bit of blood is seen on the victim's mouth. Derek punches and kicks an old man in the face once for trying to corrupt his brother Danny. Blood runs down his nose. Derek angrily shoves a mouthful of food in his sister's mouth to keep her from talking. This briefly causes her to choke. She then wields a baseball bat. A mother becomes addicted to smoking to cope with her son going to prison. Danny, Dereck's teenage brother, is shown smoking very often. People are seen smoking (including teenagers). There is a party scene with beer and some drunkenness among people Marijuana (trafficking) is briefly discussed in a prison The main character's acts of domestic violence during a dinner scene are emotionally disturbing and upsetting. This movie can be very disturbing and violent at times, but it is not scary. The main plot in this movie is about racism, and it could be disturbing for some viewers. This movie in general is intense and emotional, especially the ending. No racial group is left out of the hate exercised in this movie. 214 uses of ""fuck"", 30 uses of ""shit"", 38 uses of ""nigger"", 5 uses of ""bitch"", 4 uses of ""asshole"" and ""spic"", 3 uses of ""kike"" and ""monkey"", 3 uses of ""cracker"", 1 use of ""spooks"", ""Son of a Bitch"", ""pecker wood"", ""beaner"", ""ass"", and ""niglet"".

Profanity is used constantly throughout the entire film."

The Departed	R	6	21	10	6	3	"Costello has a girlfriend who is probably 35-40 years younger than him. In a few scenes it is implied that they will have sex. Early in the film Frank Costello calls a girl, presumably 16-18, behind the counter and asks her if she wants to have sex with him (the girl before on the counter is seen to be making eye contact with Frank) this is played as a joke. Costello is heard masturbating in a theater. He then stands up and turns around to face another character, a penis is briefly shown on screen, though it is obviously fake. Then Costello later talks about ""not understanding how people masturbate in a theater."" The act isn't shown and the scene is meant to be funny. A man and a woman passionately kiss on a bed for around 20 seconds. He is clothed, she is wearing an unbuttoned shirt with a see through bra. She is in her underwear. Many vulgar sexual references throughout Most of the movies sexual content are crude sexual references and brief nudity in the cinema scene. There's a flashback of people beating each other up over who rides the bus. A man and a woman are shot in the head with blood mist. This is shown from the side so it's not as graphic. A man fidgets with a severed hand, the bag it was in is also covered in blood A man beats someone to death somewhat offscreen with a metal pipe, blood sprays onto walls. Brief and offscreen A man throws a toy at at a mans face, a cut forms on his face.

A shootout begins between Costello's gang and some police men afterwards, a man gets shot in the stomach, large amount of blood sprays from the wound. A police officer is shot in the shoulder, blood spray, he falls to the ground, a puddle forms beneath him. Costello is seen with blood all over his clothes and arms from doing who knows what. Onscreen body count: 24. There are multiple shootings that are bloody and abrupt. Characters die unexpectedly There are some black and white pictures of dead men who executed by gangsters and mobsters. There is some blood seen on their bodies. A brief flashback of a man killing his wife. Multiple scenes of bloody violence but nothing overly graphic or gory. When Mr French and Frank search Billy they take his broken hand and bang it on the table, frank then asks him if he's a cop twice while he's hitting his arm with his boot. This can be very intense and disturbing for some viewers A man shoots himself and his car explodes A man is bashed over the head with a glass leaving a bloody wound on his head. He is later punched around the face a few times, knocking him out. A man beats up two mobsters in a store, as he punches one of them in the face repeatedly, he breaks his hand, we hear it crack, the other mobsters face is bashed with a coat hanger. Their bodies are later found in a ditch implying that they were killed. They have very bloody faces, they are seen for a few seconds. A man is roughing up another man around the face before a man is punched once, with two teeth knocked out. A man is stabbed once in the chest with a pocket knife and dies from this A man falls from a building. The impact is not seen, but some blood sprays onto a man. His body is then briefly shown with blood on his face, and a blood puddle beneath his head and his whole body A man punches another man in the face four times, leaving him with blood pouring from his nose. Two men get shot in the head with blood mist. A man throws a painting on a man's forehead, we see a big cut that's bleeding on his forehead, he then gets shot in the kneecap with blood showing, he starts to scream in pain. A group of policemen break into a crack house. Men are seen packaging bags of cocaine in a dope house. A needle and a spoon are seen on a table, implying that a man has done heroin. He then keeps on making claims that he is high. Billy is shown taking OxyContin in a few scenes. There is drug references but only a little bit of brief scenes of drug usage One of the main topics of this film is drugs (the antagonist is a drug dealer) A man tests a bag of cocaine by tasting it. A man throws cocaine on a bed and tells a woman not to get up until she is numb. A large amount of cocaine is shown in bags at one point. People are shown drinking alcohol and smoking in a number of scenes. The store beating scene is intense. Not a very scary movie but pretty intense and suspenseful. Not scary or frightening, just very intense and thrilling Very intense and heart-racing moments throughout. Costello's interrogation of Billy will make audiences cringe. Some of the violence occurs very suddenly in moments you least expect it. Constant graphic language. 237 uses of ""fuck"", 5 uses of ""cunt"" and ""cocksucker"", 24 uses of ""shit"", 10 uses of ""ass"", and 1 use each of ""faggot"" and ""son of a bitch"". 4 uses of ""damn"" (2 paired with ""God""), 2 uses of ""nigger"". References to Italians in a manner some may find offensive. Chinese and Irish slurs are also heard. Some of the language is used sexually but most of the sexual references comes from Costello"

The Usual Suspects	R	4	12	3	4	4	"Some mild innuendo and jokes. There's a blurry and stylized flashback of a rape. It happens quick and blurred so mostly of it is offscreen. A nude statue is shown from the waist up. If you blink, you'll miss it. A man talks about finding a fully nude woman in his car. A man is shot in the head. Little blood is shown. Two men are killed in an elevator leaving bloody smears and a little bit of brain matter. A charred decomposed corpse is shown. It is almost burnt until a skeleton, very hard to watch. There's a stylized and blurry flashback of a home assault. The mother is raped (part of it offscreen) and her children are threatened in front of their father. For his reputation, the father kills his family and two of the thieves. No blood is shown. A man is shot in the back. Blood splatters in front of him. Many scenes of men with guns and many men are shot and killed (with some blood). There is a shootout on a boat. A child's throat is slit in a stylised flashback. Even though there is no blood it is still quite disturbing. A man is burned in boat explosion and shown covered in bandages. The actual wound isn't shown A man shoots another man in the back with a rifle. No blood. A man shoots two men. Wounds appear and blood slowly trickles from each. They fall leaving small red stains on a car parked behind them A boat is blown up in several scenes. There are many discussions of illegal drug dealings. Some characters are shown smoking and drinking alcoholic beverages. The central event of the film is the assault on a ship rumored to be carrying 91 million dollars of cocaine The flashback to an assault on a woman and several children is quite disturbing. The many deaths throughout may be difficult for some viewers. The main characters are criminals, and they commit several crimes throughout the film. Though not frightening, viewers may find the last 10 minutes of the film amazingly intense, seeing as it spits out two twists, one right after the other. ""Cocksucker"" is used at least 8 times Non-stop language. The slur ""f*g"" is used 100 uses of ""fuck"". Along with other uses of profanity such as ""shit"", ""bitch"", ""asshole"", and ""dick""."

The Prestige	PG-13	2	9	5	3	2	"A husband is briefly seen kissing in bed with his wife. Since they're mostly clothed, there is no nudity, though, sex is mildly implied (the camera cuts almost instantly, so nothing is shown). The same married man also cheats on his wife and is seen with another woman in bed. Some of the female performers wear revealing outfits (i.e. cleavage, some leg, etc.). This is never focused upon and is merely a form of abstract attire that they wear for their performances. The tone of this movie is serious, not comedic. Two characters are dueling throughout the movie, sabotaging each other, often ending in serious injury. Some blood can be seen at times, but violent scenes are generally not gory or explicit (the movie is PG-13). See details below. A man shoots a man in the chest, the man gasps and slumps to the ground dead. We see some blood on his shirt. A woman is shown hanged. A man has a noose placed around his neck, a hatch opens beneath his feet, and we hear a crack. A bird gets crushed (quietly). We see its bloody and mutilated body later. At another point, a bird is smashed again. The camera cuts away just in time, but we see a blood splatter. A man shoots another man's hand, taking off two fingers (we briefly see the bloody digits). A man falls through stairs and into a box where he is trapped, the box is nailed shut and then buried underground (the man in the box shoots through it and strikes a man on the outside in the arm). However the man is soon dug up and rescued. A man is held by police with a nightstick across his throat, and he thrashes and struggles to get away. A man shoots another man in the chest. (This is a different scene than the one previously mentioned). There is a small and very brief spurt of blood. This is extremely hard to catch and the camera cuts as soon as it happens. Men are shown drinking alcohol in a pub. People drink alcohol in several scenes, and people drink champagne in a celebratory scene. Two magicians stick messages to each other onto the bottom of glasses of beer. One man is described as being perpetually drunk and is shown comically stumbling around and slurring his words. A man notices that something is upsetting his wife when she starts drinking more often at home. A dead body (the man that fell into the water tank) is shown for confirmation in a autopsy room. A man falls into a water tank that locks (he struggles to get out but cannot) and a man tries to break the glass but cannot before the man drowns (we see the dead man on an autopsy table, his eyes are open and his body is pale). We see bits of this scene multiple times. This movie is very intense, serious and grim. ""Sh*t"" is said once. ""B*stard"" is used a few times."

Whiplash	R	3	4	2	3	7	"No sex or nudity; some sexual references made by Fletcher and by various students. There are minor sexual references made throughout by Fletcher, but overall no nudity. Nothing graphic A man plays the drums quickly and gets an open callus. Instead of stopping, he puts on a bandage and keeps playing. Blood seeps through the bandage, and the man puts on more bandages. Fletcher throws objects, including a chair and a cymbal, and slaps Andrew in the practice sessions. Fletcher is verbally abusive to his students. Drumming involving bloodied hands. Drops of blood can also be clearly seen on drum sets. In one scene, Andrew dips his injured hand in a bucket of ice water and it becomes quite bloody. A man is shown drinking alcohol in a jazz bar. Some mild drinking involved. Some of the scenes in the film can be very intense and unexpected for sensitive viewers. Terence Fletchers meltdowns and abusive techniques are horrible and can be very hard to watch for all viewers. Although a music-themed film, the film is extremely intense throughout as well as emotional. In particular, Fletcher's treatment of his students is incredibly disturbing, to the point of outright cruelty, and will upset most viewers. Some religious profanities: ""goddamn"" and ""Jesus Christ"". Much of the language is used by Fletcher, though Andrew uses some, too. Many uses of ""fuck"". Constant uses of ""shit"", ""damn"" (along with adding God), and ""God"" or ""Jesus"". 1/2 uses of cunt. 97 uses of ""Fuck"". Terence Fletcher is extremely abusive and uses homophohic slurs to his students Other uses include ""shit"", ""prick"", ""faggot"", ""pussy"", ""dick"", ""pansy"", ""bitch"", ""ass"", ""damn"", ""hell"", ""tits"", etc"

Casablanca	PG	3	2	2	3	0	There are some sexual references however they are subtle. A few kissing scenes. A married woman indirectly mentions that she has to sleep with a man for an exit visa. It is heavily implied that Ugarte has become the victim of an extralegal German execution after his arrest. Three men are shot onscreen in the film -- the two German couriers at the opening of the film, and a German officer at the movie's climax. In none of these instances is there any blood or gore. Drugs: None The majority of the film is set in Rick's bar, and there are numerous sequences where characters are drinking and smoking. Ilsa Lund pulls a gun on Rick just prior to the climax of the film in an attempt to bluff him into giving her the letters of transit. Near the end of the movie, we see that a major figure in the film is about to stop two main characters from boarding a plane. Movie has a very intense mood. 

The Intouchables	R	6	1	4	2	1	"None. No sex or nudity. Some kissing. Some sex talk and humorous flirt between adults. Two teenagers start to kiss passionately before they get interrupted by a man they didn't notice before. Scenes of prostitutes in bikini massaging some men, but nothing farther is shown. A man tries to convince a woman to get into a bathtub with him. she tricks him with an ok and starts to unbutton her shirt but later walks off, leaving the man awkwardly half-undressed. No nudity. In several scenes a character threatens others by pulling them by the clothes and shouting. Some characters are regular smokers. Adults drink alcohol in some scenes. Adult characters share a marijuana joint. This is done for pain management A minor is believed to have possessed illegal drugs. A middle-aged disabled man experiences phantom pain and starts breathing heavily in the middle of the night, as if he is about to die. This may be intense to some. Two characters go paragliding and one of them is very scared. Several mild curses and at least 20 uses of the F-word and its variants. ""Bullshit"" is said a few times."

Once Upon a Time in the West	PG-13	7	6	7	4	7	A man grabs a woman's buttocks. A female main character is sexualized and objectified by several men throughout in one way or another. A woman is told to allow men to grab her butt and act as if it is not a big deal. A woman is said to have worked as a prostitute. A man tears an article of clothing from a woman, revealing cleavage. A woman and man lie together, the man caresses her and eventually removes her top; only her bare back (and side view, a bit of bare right breast) is seen. Also kissing. A man barges into a room a woman is bathing in, nothing is seen. This woman is later seen with only a towel on, but nothing is revealed. A bullet wound in a man's side is shown close up. Brief and not very gory. A gunfight show down between two men. In several scenes, many men are gunned down, but there is no blood spatter. In some scenes, the aftermath of a shootout is seen with moderate blood. A man is shot in the eye. It is brief, but there is blood spatter. A man is hanged.

A few men smoke and drink liquor as they play cards. A man and woman drink at an empty restaurant bar. There are several instances of cigar smoking. The climax is intense. The violence and deaths throughout may be difficult for some viewers. Some people may be disturbed by the bloody and occasionally gory violence, and the fact that one of the main characters kills a child. The funeral scene is quite upsetting 'Son of a b*tch' is said once. '*ss' is said once. 'God' is said once. 'D*mn' is said at least twice. 'H*ll' is said at least twice. 'B*stard' is said once. 'Wh*re' is said at least twice.

Alien	R	3	7	1	5	8	"A poster of a women in a skimpy uniform is shown several times throughout. During a fight scene there are posters of women with exposed breasts and pubic hair visible in the background. These are not the focus of the scene, but readily visible. Towards the end of the movie, Ripley is seen in a short tank top and panties. Her nipples poke through her top. She is in her underwear for at least 10 minutes, it's not sexual. Apart from the chest burst scene the violence and gore is of a moderate level. Overall this movie is probably on par with Jaws. Blood starts to pour and ""rain"" down on two characters, right after another character is killed offscreen The alien shoots its teeth into a man's head. (quickly, before the camera cuts away). Minor gore. In the directors cut an alien bits into a man's head. A character is killed offscreen, but their scream is heard. A man cuts a ""finger"" of a facehugger and it bleeds acid. A woman is punched, which causes her nose to bleed. The crew members smoke cigarettes and drink canned beer. The chestburster scene might be the most terrifying part of the franchise. The main characters are in mortal danger for a large portion of the film. The self-destruct sequence is quite intense. A few jump scares. The Alien itself is one of the most scary looking monster designs in movie history. The head is very obscure with no relations to any kind of humanoid attributes, which makes it very realistic. The body however is more humanoid, and at some points looks very obvious that it's a person in a costume. 4-5 uses of the F-word, as well as some milder profanity like shit and a few uses of bitch. 'F*ck' is said five times. 'Godd*mn' is said. 'H*ll' is said at least three times. 'B*stard' is said. 'H*ll' is said at least four times. 'Sh*t' is said a few times. 'B*tch' is said at least twice."

Cinema Paradiso	R	8	4	3	2	2	"As Salvatore enters the abandoned cinema near the ending of the film, a drawn penis can be seen on one of the dusty walls. In the extended edition at the end Salvatore meets Elena in a car and they kiss. Sex is implied but not shown. Later she tells him that she did it with him because in their youth they never have sex before. A woman is shown breastfeeding her baby in the cinema. A row of boys appear to be masturbating in the theater to an erotic film, and are shown from the waist up. (We see a completely nude woman lying face down for a few seconds... no graphic nudity.) A man in a theater is seen spooning a woman standing up and fondling her covered breast, and from his thrusting motions it seems a little more is going on. There are many scenes of passionate kissing from old films, and a few VERY short (less than 1 second) topless scenes. Bare breasts are shown. In the extended edition, we see teenage Salvatore encounter a man having sex with a prostitute. Thrusting is shown and heard and the man is wearing underwear. We soon hear him yell in orgasm. No nudity. Also in the extended edition, we see teenage Salvatore having sex with a prostitute. His pants are shown down sideways, and his face grimaces at a clear orgasm. No nudity. There is a fire that leaves a man injured. You can later see some pretty intense blisters, and he is shown to be blinded by it, with one scene where his empty eye sockets are visible. There is brief, very mild fighting by younger boys. There is a scene where a boy meets his girlfriend's dad, and is later shown with a bandage on his head. A boy is lightly beaten by his teacher, and another boy is hit some by his mother. There are a few violent scenes from movies, but they are old and very tame by modern standards. One of these scenes includes a gangster shootout, and another shows a man hitting a girl around. Some drinking and smoking. A character is shown drunk. Drugs, recreational: None There is some smoking, including some by young boys. A man orders a drink from a bar, and is shown taking a small drink from it before his drops the glass. Various emotional scenes throughout the film The fire scene can be upsetting and intense. Some profanities are used but the language is not very strong. An older man stares at a younger man's girlfriend, and he asks, ""What the fuck are you looking at?"". But this is seen only in the directors cut, in the theatrical version it is omitted."

Apocalypse Now	R	7	10	5	6	4	"A man is seen in his room in his underwear. A very quick glimpse of his penis can be seen before he sits down and the camera moves. A nude body is seen hanging from a tree. Male genitals are clearly seen and visible for a couple seconds. Three instances of brief male nudity, as entertainment for the troops Three Playboy Bunnies dances suggestively on a stage, they have tight fit clothing exposing cleavage, no nudity is shown and it's not too graphic. We see the dancers later in the movie being stripped by Soldiers in the Helicopter, breast are shown and sex is implied, it is pretty graphic. This scene is around 10 mins long. Male nudity (never explicit or provocative), a brief instance of female breast nudity, posters of woman posing in provocative ways, sometimes with breasts exposed (very brief), and a scene of women dancing sexual as entertainment for the troops, no nudity and not very graphic. A soldier on a boat is bottomless and we see his buttocks There are several posters of nude women wearing bikinis and exposing bare breasts. There are some sexual references among the soldiers. A soldier's leg is shot. We see a lot of blood around the wound. Civilians and soldiers alike are gunned down and killed. A man punches a mirror and cuts his hand. Blood is shown on his torso as well as on the bed sheets. There are bloody dead bodies shown throughout. The violence in this movie is more brutal than violent. Not as gory or violent as other war films such as Saving Private Ryan. This film is surprisingly not very violent, pretty much moderate. Intense war violence throughout. Accurately depicts wartime during the late 60's A buffalo is seen getting beheaded A man is beheaded. It's all offscreen, but we briefly see his head after it is removed. Marijuana is smoked a couple of times. Cigarettes are smoked consistently throughout the movie. Alcohol is used both abusively and socially used throughout the movie. It is implied a soldier is on acid in one scene Early in the movie, a soldier is seen drinking himself to limit while waiting for his assignment. Colonel Kurtz is an ex commando and he creates his own little kingdom of savage villagers. He's developed a philosophy that savage killing is genius and necessary. This film is very dark and disturbing. The lighter and/or the semi-comedic scenes within the film add a little bit of relief between intense scenes but other than that the entire film is incredibly thought provoking. Rated R for: disturbing violent images, language, sexual content and some drug use The entire film has a very eerie feel. The combat scenes may be intense to some ""Nigga"" is used by black soldiers Very strong language, including abuse of ""Christ"" and ""Jesus."" ""Fuck"" is used 86 times. ""Shit"" is used a few time, as well as uses of words referring to the male genitals, a-words, and uses of God damn/God damnit, and other less swear words. Jim Morrison's ""The End"" uses ""fuck"" multiple times in one part of it; this part can be heard in one scene of the film."

Memento	R	5	4	3	1	2	"An escort is hired, but nothing is shown past her arrival and her laying in bed clothed with a man. Rape is mentioned multiple times, but nothing is shown. We glimpse a man on top of a woman. A man takes a shower. His backside is shown after he fights another man after coming out of the shower. Very Brief. Bare buttocks can be seen. Blink and you'll miss it. A character is hit with a tire iron in the head. The character then begs for their life but is choked to death by another character. The choking lasts for a good 30 seconds. Once dead, we see a small wound with blood and a lifeless body. The first scene of the film depicts a reversed shooting, with a stream of blood oozing backwards, blood shown on the walls and floor, and then the shot itself offscreen. A man slaps and punches a woman after she makes a remark about his dead wife. A character is injected with an overdose of insulin. Drug dealing is a major element of the film's plot. A character holds a bottle of whiskey and comments about not feeling drunk. We see a woman snort something not known to the viewer; it is most likely cocaine. As aforementioned, we see the before and after of a recklessly-motivated beating; also, the aftermath of a bloody killing is seen. By far Nolan's most profane film, but not ridiculous. 'F*ck' is used numerous times in one scene, to anger another character. fuck is used 76 times 1 use of cunt a couple uses of hell A character uses ""retard"" multiple times, specifically towards another character."

Django Unchained	R	7	9	1	5	4	"Buttocks shown when a guy gets out of shower No sex scenes but some non sexual nudity. In a scene where a man is being tortured we can briefly see his butt for a few seconds In a scene a woman is taken out of a metal box. She is then brought away into a house on a wheelbarrow and one of her breasts if briefly seen. Fast and could fly over some viewer's heads, only seen for a split second. A naked man is shot in the genitals - blink and you'll miss it After a male slave wins a fight, his owner cheers in triumph and decides to have a female slave sent to his room to ""lick his pole"" as a reward. For a few seconds, you can see parts of a man's butt. A brief whipping scene that is not bloody at all. There are two kinds of violence in this film: gunplay/shootouts, which are stylized and over-the-top, almost cartoonish, with comical amounts of blood; the other type of violence is inflicted upon the poor and the slaves which is rather intense and sad, meant to show the horrible nature of slavery. Violence isnt constant but when it does happen it often gets bloody. A fully-clothed man is shot in the crotch. He screams and flails wildly. This lasts for about 30 seconds. An explosion happens where multiple horse and men die. Then a main character shoots someone and they fall of their horse. Blood is seen on the horse. Django shoots a man in the chest, blood is seen. He then whips another man and shoots him. Then a character shoots a man off his horse and blood lands on some flowers. A man shoots a man in the stomach and then shoots him in the head. Bloody. A horse is shot in the head, resulting in a spray of blood. The horse topples, landing on a man, breaking his leg. A man is tied upside down and it is implied that he is about to be hurt. However, the villain is interrupted before the deed is done. Several men are shown drinking, a lot of smoking is done as well. Not scary or frightening. Just violent and bloody. Most of the violence is towards bad slave owners which makes the violence more satisfying than disturbing. The action and violence is very stylish, unrealistic and even funny, but when the violence goes to black slaves the violence turns more brutal, realistic and very hard to watch The scenes where the violence goes to the slaves are intense and hard to watch Most of the violence in this movie is directed towards slave owners, only a few scenes have slave violence Racial slurs throughout. The n-word is used more than 100 times. 31 uses of ""fuck"". Many uses of ""son of a bitch"""

The Lives of Others	R	3	1	3	3	1	"A couple of scenes of sexual intercourse. In one scene, a major character is seen
having sex with a prostitute while seated in a chair and she is straddling him. In another scene the protagonist is having sex with his girlfriend. In both of these scenes we see breasts and buttocks. There are two scenes with a major female character taking a shower, and she is shown mostly from the rear. A prostitute undresses she shows prolongued rear nudity A character commits suicide, but it's only talked about. Quite a few of the adult characters smoke during the movie. The major female character is seen taking some sort of drug in a pill form, probably the Aponeuron that she purchases later (a medication that the body converts to amphetamine). It is not clear whether it is really illegal or not - the context is that the state would prohibit her from taking this particular drug but not necessarily because it is immoral. The protagonist and another character are sharing a drink from a bottle. The gentleman has several other bottles there as well. The protagonist lights up a cigarette at this time also. There are several scenes where characters drink cocktails. In one scene two of the major characters are in a quiet bar, and the male drinks two shots of vodka while the female drinks a shot of cognac. There is no scene in the movie where anyone is shown to be intoxicated. One intense scene very early in the movie when a prisoner deprived of sleep is being interrogated and is seen breaking down when threatened with the arrest of his wife and the institutionalization of his children. The film does get a bit depressing at times and has the overall feeling of militant oppression when the Communists were in power. During a class scene of would-be interrogators, taught by a senior and respected Stasi interrogator, a student asks a question that shows sympathy to the prisoners plight. The instructor then makes a mark on the seating chart where this student is sitting perhaps to keep an eye on this student as a possible prisoner sympathizer or of the wrong character to do the job well. The movie dialog is in German with subtitles. There is one scene where an angry character is seen exclaming ""Scheiße!"" and the word ""S***!"" is printed as a subtitle. Otherwise, none."

The Shining	R	6	6	3	6	4	"There are photos of nude women on a man's apartment walls in one scene; bare breasts are shown. Non sexual but they are clearly seen for about 10-15 seconds total. These are only paintings however. At the start of the film Jack reads a ""Playgirl"" magazine which is the equivalent of a ""Playboy"" magazine but with men. The magazine is hardly visible. And not focused on The nudity is not presented in a sexual manner. In an awkward scene we can see a man in a bear costume giving another man implied fellatio (not graphic), the scene appears abruptly but ends quickly within a few seconds. Jack calls Wendy a ""sperm bank"". A naked attractive women who is having a bath stands up when Jack enters the bathroom. As she walks towards him there is full frontal female nudity. A man is killed with an axe blow to the chest (bloody but not excessively so). Violent acts are discussed, plotted, and threatened. An elevator lets out a river of blood. This image is shown several times during the course of the movie. No visible injuries are shown to any characters throughout this scene. Overall not a lot of violence especially for a horror film, and the violent moments which do occur aren't especially graphic. There is a scene where you see two mangled dead bodies of girls in a corridor surrounded by pools of blood, as well as an axe. A man smashes down a wooden door with an axe while a woman hides with a knife in her hand. She slices his hand with the knife; blood is briefly visible. The protagonist orders a drink twice; in his past he had problems with alcoholism. A man drinks. A woman smokes cigarettes. It is a very scary film. May frighten most. The scene where a woman finds a room where a man is kneeling down in a bear costume with another man is very bizarre and might creep out some viewers. This film contains disturbing depiction of madness and the effects of cabin fever. It isnt that violent or gory, but it is very terrifying. The score throughout the movie is incredibly eerie and over the top creepy. It applies to the atmosphere of tension, mystery, terror and suspense that sets the tone of the film. The soundtrack is meant to be visceral, disturbing, overlapping, loud, unsettling, maniac, and sudden. The music is what also makes the film very terrifying,very suspenseful & also very exciting to watch but,it might give the audience a headache. Due to its dark atmosphere and creepy tone, this movie gives off an uncomfortable vibe from start to finish. In one scene, a small child is riding down the hall on a toy tricycle and sees two girls' ghosts (and then flashbacks of their bloody hacked up corpses). 10 uses of ""fuck"",10 uses of ""goddamn"",3 uses of ""nigger"",1 use of ""assholes"" and 3 uses of ""son-of-a-bitch"" Jack's language becomes cruder and more profane as his mental state deteriorates. A racist reference is said by a character towards jack and repeated back by Jack. Some minor religious profanity."

Avengers: Infinity War	PG-13	5	6	0	4	4	"A couple is staying together in a hotel room, but the scene set there is brief. When the couple are attacked while taking a walk, one says to the other, dryly, that they should have stayed in bed. Rocket makes a reference to hiding an object by sticking it up his... He is cut off before he finishes his sentence, but it is strongly implied he would have said butt or any other related word. Star Lord makes a reference to attaching a grenade to someone's ""junk"". There are a few kisses between couples. There are a few kissing scenes The film features extended scenes of fantasy violence and action sequences. There is a big fight sequence with Aliens. Many aliens are killed but barely any blood. The violence in this movie is more intense than any previous Marvel movie. There are plenty of brutal beatings, stabbings, choking, and heavy hitting. Although most of the action is bloodless. The film basically has non-stop action and, unlike most MCU films, it has a dark tone to it and much is because of the spontaneous violence there is in certain scenes. In addition to standard comic book film destruction, characters are tortured, impaled, and beaten. While generally bloodless, the consequences feel greater, and could upset younger viewers. Multiple scenes of stabbing, some of them leading to death, others leading to open wounds, with much of them being immediately healed.  There is a balance between humorous and dramatic moments but Infinity War has a very dark and bleak tone. Characters are attacked by violent alien creatures which may be intense for some. This film is very dark and contains the look and tone of a doomsday movie, with several dangerous situations, many beloved characters seen in previous films dying in the most tragic way possible, intense depictions of terrorism and genocide, a devastatingly tragic ending, and much more action and violence compared to the rest of the MCU films. However there are still plenty of comedic moments throughout. Thanos' extraterrestrial Black Order is frightening. Characters Ebony Maw, Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight, and Cull Obsidian make up the Black Order, and they all have frightening appearances. Someone starts to say ""motherf..."" but is cut off before finishing the next word. One character shows his middle finger to the villain. A few uses of ""Asshole"" 5 uses of shit 1 paired with horse 1 paired with dip 1 paired with bull"

Aliens	R	4	10	4	7	7	"There is no sexual content in this movie besides mild references. Only in the ""Director's Cut"" Version is a brief side shot of a locker that has a nude poster. Breasts are visible. Ripley is shown in a tank top and panties twice during the movie. She is seen in her underwear for about three minutes total. Some of Ripley's pubic hair can be seen poking out of her panties in one scene. Easy to miss. Moderate action violence throughout with death scenes (some offscreen) that contain little or mild blood spurts. No gore or violent death details. A baby Xenomorph is burned to death by a flamethrower. The movie's lighting is very dark, so many of the scenes that contain any gore are hard to see The overall violence is moderate level, so it is not too hard for adolescent or PG-level viewing. An alien attacks a woman offscreen, but you see blood splattering on the windows of the cockpit she was in. Dead corpses are seen wrapped in cocoons; a chestburster alien rips through a living woman's chest. Some blood pours out, although not as much as the chestburster from the first movie. A woman has a dream that an alien bursts out of her; the alien can be seen under her skin just before she wakes up. Several times, people are killed both on and offscreen with minimal blood. A Marine character is seized by an alien and in a panic, discharges her flamethrower, setting her comrade alight. In a blind panic, he accidentally falls over a railing a plummets to his death. In the process, he drops his flaming bag of ammunition, which explodes and throws two other Marine characters. One of them is hurled into a wall and snaps his neck. A Marine character shoots an alien in the head. There are a few scenes where characters smoke cigarettes. The main character Ripley smokes in a few scenes as does Hicks. Apone smokes cigars frequently. There are a few scenes with smoking. The main character Ripley smokes in a few scenes as does Hicks. Apone smokes cigars frequently. The climax is quite intense. The many deaths during the film are quite frightening. Some intense peril and scary creature violence Mild to moderate horror scenes, however the film is more action and adventure oriented rather than 'scary'. Though special and visual effects tend to get outdated in a decade or so and become unrealistic, this film's special effects are done so well they still look convincing. Children growing up seeing only CGI monsters now may be frightened by the aliens ""really"" being present in front of the camera. Several Marines are in danger of extremely scary and vicious alien creatures. The film is more action-oriented than the extremely suspenseful and frightening first film (Alien). There is one intense scene where Ripley and the girl are both in mortal danger of being ""impregnated"" by a crab-like creature that crawls around in an empty laboratory while they sleep. 25 f words in the theatrical version and I think 14-15 in the special edition. 'Godd*mn' is said. 'Sh*thead' is said once. '*ss' is said several times, and 'dumb-*ss' is said once. 'Sh*t' is said many times. 'D*mn' is said at least six times. 'F*ck' is said about 25 times in the theatrical version, and about 15 times in the special edition version."

Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse	PG	1	3	1	6	2	"There is a quick scene of a kiss between Spider-Man and his girlfriend Frequent animated action violence throughout. Punches, kicks, shooting with laser guns, etc. Lots of animated violence, fighting including guns. Extreme physical fights and fighting. Repititive action fighting and violence. Very slight, but visible, infrequent blood on characters' faces during intense fight scenes. No drugs or smoking There are several deaths in the movie that could be intense/sad for viewers. There is a scene that lasts less than five minutes with an animated spider crawling around, which can still be scary to those with arachnophobia. There are at least two jump scares in this film that will startle most audience members. This film has non-stop action violence. While largely an animated comedy, it does contains some fairly dark scenes with character deaths and thematic elements. The final battle is very intense. Scene where a dark and frightening creature enters a space in search of another character. I believe for kids this could be very scary even though animated. It has a nightmarish/anxiety dream quality and the main character (teen) is frightened and hiding. The villain here looks scary and intimidating. Very mild language like ""Hell of a freaking lightshow,"" and ""crap,"" are used. In one rap song, the line ""You got a hat? It's for the ho's"" can be heard, but it may be easy to miss. Damn is used comedically by Aunt May in one scene."

Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb	PG	5	4	2	2	1	"There are pictures of women in their underwear on the inside of the safe door in the B-52.

As the paranoid commander has told his own troops that the incoming troops are Warsaw troops in disguise, they violently resist. No blood is shown. There are scenes of nuclear explosions. There is also a suicide, not shown on screen. It is almost a punchline. Sterling Hayden's character (General Ripper) frequently has a cigar in his mouth. Characters are shown smoking cigars. Some of the black humor can be especially dark and bleak. This is a black comedy about accidental use of atomic bombs. Some scenes of nuclear explosions could be frightening or intense.

The Dark Knight Rises	PG-13	3	20	4	4	11	"Bruce and Miranda are seen in bed. No nudity, but sex is implied. Batman and Catwoman/Selina Kyle share a 3-5 second kiss Several men are shown shirtless in a non-sexual context. Several thugs lower themselves on cables from a large airplane to a smaller one in mid-air; gunfire erupts for an extended period and soldiers die with bloodied faces and chests and the thugs break and cut the smaller plane into pieces until nothing is left. Bane breaks the necks of several people (the bodies drop dead). Bane steals army tanks and uses them against the police and citizens, killing many people (bloody wounds are on the faces and chests of bodies lying in the street). Thugs hold a man down and drain some blood from his body into an unconscious one using a needle and tubing. Thugs shoot up the stock exchange, kill several men and women and tie hostages on motorcycles. Some hostages are freed or rescued. Many police cruisers give chase and are stopped by a large truck pulled across a road. Men are shown hanging by the neck from a bridge in the distance. Catwoman fights off men in groups of 2 to 6 throughout the film with martial arts techniques: a few times, she points a handgun at the head of one of the men and shoots a few others in the head; she rides a huge motorcycle, shoots thugs pursuing her in tanks and SUVs (a little blood), and launches a missile to blow up a stack of crushed cars blocking a subway tunnel. Several kidnappings occur, with pistol whippings that leave men with bloody foreheads and scars. Men are dragged away through the streets, shot and killed (some bloody chests). Bruce is told that he is missing all cartilage from both knees and elbows and we see scars over his kidneys and other damage. Several violent and long fistfights occur between Batman and Bane (both are injured, but little blood is shown); we hear grunts and shouts. A police officer fights off and shoots dead two armed attackers. Gordon is found in a room by Blake, having shot two armed attackers, the gun shots having been heard. Thugs blow up sewers and subway tunnels with hand grenades and bombs that explode in smoke and fire; at one point, the entire city is filled with the dust from falling concrete, fire, smoke and falling buildings, reminiscent of the 9/11 tragedy. Several scenes include rushing waters in a wide sewer system, with two bodies floating in the water. Dead bodies with blood on their heads lie in a hospital corridor as SWAT team members run through carrying rifles. Selina stands beside a large archery target as a huge arrow strikes the bull's eye and she shouts in surprise. Selina somersaults backward out a second-story window to escape capture as a jewel thief and lands on her feet. Bruce is shown falling from a tunnel wall on a number of occasions and is saved by a guide rope tied around his waist. This film is not graphically violent (the camera usually cuts away quickly when someone is injured and we see very little blood), but the fighting and beatings are strong and can upset some people. A man drinks from a glass of whiskey. A man drinks from a glass of wine. A man in an outdoor café drink a glass of sherry. A cocktail party shows glasses of wine on tables. Bane is very dominant and aggressive. Bane's incredibly violent behavior is incredibly disturbing and occasionally shocking. His distorted voice is eerie and his mask can be frightening. Unlike ""The Dark Knight's"" Joker, Bane is less creepy and more menacing. This film is very dark and contains the look and tone of a doomsday movie, with several hostage situations, intense depictions of terrorism and anarchy, and the complete absence of law and order. This is especially true of the fact that this film takes 8 years after the Joker's plot of taking over Gotham City finally coming to fruition. Scenes set within a foreign prison can be disturbing as there are moments of violence and screaming. An angry man yells at a woman. ""You took my wallet! You fff....... you took my wallet!"" (It is implied he was about to say 'f*ck', but it is not heard at all.) 'Sons of bitches' is yelled very loudly. 'D*ckhead' is said once. 'Sh*t' is said once. 'Godd*mn' is said once. 'B*tch' is said twice. 'H*ll' is said eight times. 'D*mn' is said twice. 'B*stard' is said once. 'Balls' is said once in a vulgar manner. Obscenities include 1 use of ""god damn,"" 2 uses of ""bitch,"" 8 uses of ""hell,"" 2 uses of ""damn,"" 1 use of ""bastard,"" and 1 use of ""balls,""."

Oldboy	R	7	13	3	5	4	"A man violently kisses a woman against her will, and is seen noticeably attempting to grope her. However, she hits him in the head, and he simply leaves. During sex scene close up of bare butt of a woman. A man and woman have sex for 30 seconds. There is a brief shot of her breasts and buttocks. The majority focuses on shoulders up or is seen from a distance with not much detail. A woman's bare breasts are briefly visible in one scene (most of the time she's in the distant background). She's also still mostly clothed. This is not a sex scene. A woman's stomach is shown for a few seconds as something's being written on it. A man's buttocks are briefly visible in a shower. A man briefly masturbates while watching a clothed woman on TV. Only chest up shown. A man tricks another man into playing a video tape of him and a young woman having sex. There's nothing seen (obviously) But we hear their sexual comments and a lot of sexual moaning. Stylized, but graphic violence. Not as violent as many people make it out to be, but still very violent at some points. A man attempts suicide by cutting his wrist in a couple scenes, plenty of blood is seen on the ground. Stock footage of disasters like 9/11 are shown for effect in one scene. A man commits suicide by jumping off a building. He lands on a car, startling several nearby people, but this isn't very graphic. A man rips out several of another man's teeth with a hammer as a form of torture. There is plenty of blood seen and the act is briefly seen up close. Later, he's seen with a very bloody rag in his mouth. In a long, realistic fight scene, a man hits several other men with a hammer while they hit him with several blunt weapons. The men are seen in various stages of pain from blunt force trauma. At one point, the lone man is stabbed in the back and beaten up. He's seen exhausted and covered in blood, and later with bloody bandages. A man attempts to rip out another man's teeth (in revenge for the man doing it to him) but gets stopped before he can. He then hits the man in the head with a bat, and he's seen in great pain. The attempted victim then threatens to cut of the others hand for molesting a woman. A man is stabbed to death with a broken disk by another man, this is hard to see as it's dimly lit, but it's still clear what happens. A man's severed hand is seen briefly. A man gets into a fight with another man, he's violently thrown about a room, against several glass objects. Eventually, the second man is stabbed in the ear with a pair of scissors, destroying his eardrum. Blood is seen leaking out of his ear while he attempts to stab the first man in the neck. He's then shot in the head before he can kill the first man. A man is seen completely covered in blood after another man is shot and killed in front of him. A man shoots himself in the head, this is graphically seen with lots of blood and a bullet wound on his head. Infrequent but very strong, however there are two scenes which are quite graphic but they don't last for more than just a couple of seconds and the worst bits are not shown. Some smoking teenagers are shown smoking. A character gets sprayed with a gaseous form of Valium every night while imprisoned. The opening scene shows the main character in police custody for drunkeness. Other than this there is little to no drug use. A scene of a man having his teeth extracted using a hammer which is really intense. A scene of a man cutting his own tongue using scissors. A man is eating a live octopus raw which can be frighting for some viewers. Most of the torture scenes are offscreen, but sounds and other visuals can make the scenes just as disturbing without the graphic details. The entire film is very dark and depressing and the violent scenes could be very hard for some people to watch. The word 'fuckhead' is seen written on a chalkboard in one shot. NOTE: In Korean, with English subtitles. 3 uses of ""God"", and 1 of ""Lord"". 6 instances of ""hell"". 8 uses of 'fuck', 7 of 'bastard', 6 of 'asshole', 5 of 'son of a bitch', 3 of 'dickshit', and 1 of 'dick', 'cocksucker', and 'shit'."

Joker	R	5	7	3	3	1	"Bare chested male dancing in his underwear When Arthur is telling jokes on stage, he flips through his notebook quickly showing a picture of a nude woman on one page. However this is almost impossible to see. During arthurs stand up his book show drawings of animated Full Frontal female Nudity Arthur washes his mother in a bathtub but nothing is shown. Probably less than a minute in the movie you see an inappropriate billboard that says ""Strip Search"" with three women that look naked but it's not detailed. A man is shot by a police officer on the subway. No blood seen. Violence is a theme throughout most of this film, people are shot in the head on a few occasions, with blood splattering. It's not quite horror film levels, but some scenes are particularly shocking. No gore, but some blood with most of the kills, as violence is a vocal point in the movie. This movie is not that visually violent. Its dark tone should be the concern for most people. The film's violence isn't as intense or graphic as it is shocking. The film contains a few shootings and stabbings with brief injury detail. While it's not excessively bloody or gory, it's in your face when it happens and mostly used for impact. The violence is realistic and quite strong, but it isn't very detailed. There's no gore and the blood sprays are mild to moderate, and we also never really see any wounds or injury detail other than the bloodshed present. Arthur Fleck smokes frequently throughout the film. Three men are shown drunk in the subway. The main character smokes a lot and takes medication. However, neither are used in violent or abusive ways. This is an incredibly dark, serious movie. It revolves around a man who is mentally ill and has a condition where he laughs uncontrollably, even in serious situations. Throughout the movie, he gains a sick twisted sense of humor that revolves around death and chaos. Throughout the movie the main character is constantly tormented by society and mistreated by pretty much everyone he comes into contact with. He is punched in the face, kicked at while being helpless on the ground, and called names. All of this inspires him to dress up as a clown and become a criminal. The Joker commits several violent crimes throughout the film, and although the violence is not too frequent, all of the scenes in which The Joker commits the crimes are particularly shocking although not too gruesome. 25 uses of ""fuck"" (4 of which are bleeped out on a TV program), and a few uses of ""shit"", as well as milder terms such as ""prick"" and ""asshole""."

Amadeus	R	5	2	2	0	2	Salieri interrupts Mozart and his girlfriend as they attempt sex. Several men are fully nude in a mental institution. One man is fully nude with his genitals visible, and other men's backsides can be seen. In the extended director's cut, a woman tries to seduce a man by stripping nude. Her bare breasts are seen briefly in a few shots. A man sensuously kisses the breasts of a woman in a low-cut gown. The theatrical version doesn't include the nudity. When two men open the door, an old man was injured. Blood is shown on his hands. One mild image of blood on a character who has just attempted suicide. Mozart is shown drinking copious amounts of alcoholic beverages. Mozart is seen with a large container of an alcoholic beverage during all of Salieri's concertos. He is intoxicated at the end of each scene due to that.  The theatrical version doesn't include the C word. 'Cunt' is used once. 'Shit' is said three times. 'Ass' and 'piss' are used once each. And a few uses of 'damn' and 'hell.'

Inglourious Basterds	R	2	12	2	2	4	"Two people are implied to have had sex, nothing explicit and no nudity is shown. One character kisses another (incredibly brief). Inside a jail cell, two nazi soldiers are shot by machine guns with blood spurts. Another nazi is shot and blown offscreen. One has his throat slit, we see his neck open and lots of blood spilling out. Several nazis are shot up inside a car by machine guns, blood splatters all over the windshield. Insanely bloody, brutal, sadistic, vicious, messy violence throughout. At the end of the film, a man is released and the man who was released shoots a police officer in front of him. All the violence is very frequent and horrific. When it appears, it's extremely intense, detailed and disturbing. Examples include throat slittings, scalpings, gunshots and other incredibly gruesome moments. Unlike the rest of Tarantino's films, this film has unflinchingly graphic and realistic violence, with no exaggerated blood spurts and it's all portrayed seriously. An entire family is repeatedly graphically shot to death while hiding under the floor. We don't see their bodies. A girl survives and runs away covered in blood crying. Several dead men are scalped by other men wielding large knives. These images are short, but graphic in detail as we see bloody flesh and muscle being brutally cut off from their scalps. A man beats a Nazi to death by bashing his head in repeatedly with a baseball bat until his head gorily and very graphically explodes. Although we see this from a distance, it is extremely graphic and gruesome. Afterwards, a man is fatally shot in the back in a brutal manner. There is a brief scene where a man is shown being mercilessly whipped. His back is very bloody. In an earlier flashback, the same man is seen brutally murdering various Nazis by stabbing them to death, strangling them with a wire, and suffocating them. Extremely graphic and bloody. A shootout occurs in a bar. Two men are shot at point blank range in the groin, blood spurts are visible. Many people die afterwards from gunshots and stabbings in this scene. Very bloody and fairly intense. A woman is shot in the leg, but survives. However, she is later interrogated by another man inserting his finger into the bloody bullet hole on her leg. There is lots of blood in this scene. A woman shoots a guy in the back several times. The man then shoots her in the chest several times, and we see lots and lots of blood graphically spurt out of her body and some is thrown onto the camera lens. Both end up being dead with dozens of extremely bloody bullet holes in their bodies, and there are lots of blood pooling on the floor. A ludicrously bloody and disturbing scene. Drinking and smoking throughout. Tobacco use indicates the time period. One scene in a bar where characters are drunk. A man snorts a white powder from a tin. There are lots of brutal bloody violence throughout the film, and while some of it is over-the-top, all of it is extremely realistic as mentioned before, making this quite possibly Tarantino's most violent film by a long mile. Colonel Landa may be funny or frightening for some, depending on the viewer. The atitudes taken by the Basterds (like scalping or the swastika in the forehead) can be seen as intense and horrible, but it has a comedic tone. 22 uses of the F-word Strong profanity throughout Pretty moderate in comparision with other Tarantino films The film's title is a profanity, but with an ""e"" instead of an ""a"". Probably the mildest profanity in the movie."

Coco	PG	3	1	1	8	0	"A painter is seen painting a person who is naked. However, the person is a skeleton and so there is no actual nudity aside from bare bones. Comedic. A character changes a word in a song to make it appropriate for ""children present"", implying that the line was about how ""her (knockers)...drag on the floor"". Kids won't understand it, but adults will get the joke. It is mentioned that Ernesto De La Cruz's music caused people to fall in love with him Abuela intentionally smashes Miguel's guitar in a heated argument. Alcohol is present. One character drinks a shot. Some tense chase scenes. A character falls from a great height. A murder scene is played out and is sensitive to some viewers. Pepita's roar can startle viewers. Many skeletons lose limbs and their skulls and other body pieces throughout the second half of the movie. Eyeballs also fall through the head into the mouth of one skeleton. Extremely emotional moments, deaths, (not graphic) intense moments, etc. are all over the place. Pretty sad for a kids movie. The finale will most likely make you cry. Even as an adult, let alone your kid. The movie contains some horror scenes "

Braveheart	R	9	17	1	2	5	"The evil English King issues a law that every Scot must give up their newly-wed wife to be used sexually by an English officer on her nuptial night. None of this is shown, but the implications and discussion. There is implied rape and attempted rape, it never happens and the rapist who attempted it is killed. Brief nudity during a sex scene, sexual dialogue and attempted and implied rape. Murron stands naked in front of William in the forest. Her breasts and nipples are clearly seen for an extended period of time. William Wallace and his wife embrace while naked beside a lake the night after their wedding. The outline of her bare breasts are shown from the side and from the front as she slowly turns. The scene lasts for several seconds and the lighting is dark but can be clearly seen. A man and woman kiss passionately in each other's arms, and then lie upon a bed. They are implied to be nude but are only shown from the shoulders on up. Later, the woman becomes pregnant with the man's child. Scottish soldiers lift up their kilts to taunt the English army before a battle. We see frontal nudity, which includes penis, hair and testicles, but it is from far away so detail isn't really shown. There is a mild reference to male erections in a scene in which William and his friends jokingly talk about making spears ""as big as a man"" to which one replies, ""Some men are longer than others."" The man's father then laughingly says, ""Aye, your mother's been telling you stories about me, eh?"" A woman says her lover talked a lot in bed, and that ""Englishmen don't know what a tongue is for."" A large group of men, and some women and even children, are seen hanging inside a thatch house. This is especially terrifying for a young boy character to see. William cuts off a man's head and sends it to the king. The king reaches inside the box and pulls out the head, freezing in cold shock as he does so. William screams at a charging general on horseback. He then strikes the general's horse in the face with his sword, cutting it down from under him. He then beheads the general in full view onscreen. Very strong violence, highly realistic and a very high body count. The camera is perched by a dead man's bloody corpse. We see the blood and wounds. Graphic. (Deleted. Personal opinions about suitable viewing ages are not appropriate for the Parents Guide.) A couple of violent battle sequences. There is slashing and stabbing throughout and the blunt ends of weapons are often used. Multiple men are hit on the head/face. Sometimes heads and limbs are very quickly chopped off with some blood. In a few scenes, men are shot with arrows and horses and riders are thrown and killed. A man has his face impaled by another man's knife. Several other people have their heads smashed with mallets. A man is thrown from a terrace and falls upon a large wooden spike which impales his torso. Survivors are seen searching among the dead for their loved ones on the field after a battle A brief fist fight and struggle breaks out between English soldiers and Scots villagers; a knife is held to a man's throat. A man is crushed by a ball and chain offscreen. An attempted rape is thwarted by biting and hitting (with a rock). A woman on horseback is struck in the face with a long stick, knocking her semi-unconscious A soldier slits a woman's throat with a knife. (The shot is from the back but graphic sound is heard.) Later, the soldier is punished by having his throat slit in the same manner. The entire act is shown this time, with the bloody gaping wound shown as the man wheezes for breath before dying. A severed head is pulled out of a box in closeup briefly. A man's face is briefly seen smashed by a ball and chain. A man is tortured and killed by stretching, racking, gutting, and beheading. (offscreen for the most part, and more emotional than violent) A young man is hurled from a window, falling to his death. Wallace traps a group of English soldiers in a hut which he then burns. They are shown writhing and screaming in oil before fire is applied to the hut. People are shown drinking. Corpses hang from the ceiling of a room. Very graphic and frightening. Braveheart is an emotionally-intense film. Medieval Scottish slangs, but also uses of ""shit"" ""fuck"" and ""bastard"" 1 use of Jesus, hell and damn 2 uses of fuck 3 uses of bitch and arse 4 uses of shit 1 used as shite 7 uses of bastard 2 uses use of ""fuck"". 2 uses of ""bitch"" by a rapist. About 3 or 4 shits and 5-7 bastards."

The Boat	R	5	10	2	3	1	"Several men grab their genital areas and urinate on the windshield of a passing vehicle. A man in a brothel grabs and roughly fondles the fully-clothed breasts of a passing woman. Some brief full-frontal female nudity, seen in a picture near the beginning of the movie. A man shoots at the picture; Bullet holes hit both nipples and the crotch area. Someone then spritzes seltzer water into the crotch of the female singer. A crewman has his buttocks showing during an alarm and several crewmen have their buttocks showing during a crabs inspection. A man graphically describes a sexual practice to his bunkmates. A man is seen with blood from his head that went down to his face. Some mild-moderate violence. (Not in order) A submarine is frequently bombed, with explosions seen and damage from the interior. A merchant ship is attacked. People are seen burning and falling off the side of the boat, screaming for help. A crewman is nearly swept overboard. When he's brought into the sub, he has an open wound. A man prepares to shoot a person who has gone insane, nothing happens. A man is shot by a plane, is later seen covered in blood while screaming from the pain. A lot of characters are shot and killed, blood seen. Some dead bodies seen, with bloody bullet wounds. Blood comes out of the mouth of an injured man, he then falls to the floor. Drugs, recreational: None Some characters are seen drinking and smoking in a few scenes. A man goes insane, but later recovers. All scenes where the submarine is bombed are very intense. This feeling is often enhanced with the crew dreading the sound of sonar pings of the Allies' Navy ships, knowing as they get louder and faster, the enemy is homing in on their position to attack. Some distressing scenes towards the end of the film. A few uses of the ""F"" word, sometimes used sexually. Some mild language."

Avengers: Endgame	PG-13	2	9	2	1	1	"There is no sex or nudity in this film. Steve and Peggy kiss right before the credits roll. A character is impaled through the chest from behind and dies. A character returns from battle, covered in blood. In one scene a male gets a shuriken thrown at his face, we then see five to six others get stabbed or sliced by a sword. A characters stabs an enemy repeatedly in the back with daggers with a little bit of blood spraying each stab. (Blood is purple) There are multiple sci-fi action sequences, and mayhem throughout, including a 40 minute war sequence. There are fight scenes throughout the movie. Some are intense, especially the final battle. Lots of fighting scenes with hardly any blood. In a scene, Nebula's prosthetic hand melts when she picks up the Power Stone, revealing a skeletal structure. This may be frightening for some. Intense sci-fi superhero violence without much blood. Thor is seen drinking A LOT of beer and alcohol and you can see supplies outside and around the house. He looks for a drink numerous times throughout. Thor, Korg, and Miek are shown drinking lots of alcohol. This is a dark and bleak film, and despite its fair share of comedic moments, the whole film has the tone, look and feel of a dystopian movie. There's also a persistent sense of hopelessness throughout the film, making the tone even grittier. 2 uses of ""dickhead,"" 10 uses of ""shit,"" 2 uses of ""Goddamn"" 1 use of ""bitch,"" a few uses of ""ass,"" and 1 use of ""piss."""

Princess Mononoke	PG-13	5	9	1	7	4	"The main male character is seen in his underwear. This was in order to cross the river. Brief and not meant to be suggestive. Some mild innuendo. A few scenes of the main male character with his arm or arms around a girl. A few offhand references to brothels. Many women wear loose clothing that displays cleavage, but it is not sexual by any means. Many people attempt to shoot a teen girl until after many shots she is shot in the face, however she survives unharmed and the shot shatters a mask she is wearing and does not harm her. Arms get chopped off, and the bone and muscle is shown in extreme detail. Although spread out, it does get quite brutal at times. Although animated, there are several battle scenes throughout the film. These scenes can show human cruelty. A notable scene features samurai raiding a village and slaughtering innocent people. This scene alone features decapitation and several limbs being cut off and man swinging his sword at a woman's back. Her backpack protects her from being killed. A man has his arms shot off by an arrow, and another man has his head shot off with an arrow. The former is seen up close, but briefly, the latter is seen from a distance without detail, but then seen up close with plenty of detail. A man has his arm cut off with a sword, and another man is shot in the chest with an arrow, though little detail is seen and it's fairly brief. Many instances of men being shot with arrows and guns, but blood is not shown. A man is shown being shot with a gun, but the bullet passes through him harmlessly. The wound still bleeds through his clothes. Eventually, plenty of blood is seen leaking all over him and he soon passes out from blood loss. Animals are shot at and bombed with grenades (neither are graphic). A wild boar dies, we see its body burn and deteriorate. A wolf is shot at and we are shown the bloody entry hole of the bullet. The dead (but not bloody) bodies of animals are shown. An elk is shot with an arrow and has blood dripping down it's leg. A massive boar with multiple bloody injuries is shown. A boar vomits out huge amounts of red sickly blood a couple of times in a row. A mythological animal is shot with a gun and there is a brief splurt of blood. Some characters drink sake, as was common in the time period This movie isn't like other Studio Ghibli movies, it's very intense and rather violent throughout, rather than humorous. This Movie is very violent but all violence/gore is animated The film contains moderate violence but briefly. This is Studio Ghibli's most violent and darkest film, even topping ""Grave of the Fireflies"". A creature under a magical curse is covered with a mass of worm-like tentacles, giving it a horrific, spider-like appearance. The opening scene in which the creature is met is very intense, and ends with flesh melting off the creature's bones, leaving a huge bloody skeleton behind it. A character is placed under a curse which appears as a black-violet scar on his arm. As the curse progresses the scar spreads as far as his back and chest; at times it becomes agitated and causes the arm to swell grotesquely. There are some very creepy looking creatures. One character asks if soup tastes like ""Donkey Piss"". In the actual Japanese version, the character simply says that it tastes like hot water. Japanese version: two uses of d*mn English version: About 5 uses of ""damn,"" a few ""bastards,"" 1 use of ""piss,"" 2 uses of ""Oh my God"" Some name-calling, but nothing too bad (i.e. ""wolf girl,"" ""idiot,"" ""moron,"" ""ruler of beasts,"" ""dope,"" ""dumb,"" etc.)"

She is shown having sex with other teenagers and older men Early in the movie a young man and woman are kissing in a movie theater. A gangster pulls them apart so he can see the man's face. He reacts angrily so the hood pulls a gun. With it he pulls open the woman's blouse exposing her right breast completely. There is a closeup of the breast and aroused nipple. The hood presses the muzzle of his gun into the woman's nipple. Robbery/rape victim later meets the gang. They then playfully expose their genitals so she can decide who was her rapist. No nudity is seen. She ends up fondling and kissing some of them after they have redressed. While a young boy watches through a peep hole, a young woman removes her costume and full rear nudity is seen. During a robbery, a man rapes a woman by throwing her down against a table face down.

The first one is brief, the second one goes on for several minutes. There is a rape scene in a car, we see the woman's breasts and a view of her perineum/vulva as she is lifted up by the rapist is clear though darkened. This scene is very disturbing. A man is shot in the eye. Subsequently, the car with the dead man is raided with bullets by a couple of guys in another car. Later, a man who escaped is shot and killed. Very graphic and disturbing for young viewers. The violence is more graphic than The Godfather and Goodfellas, but not as bad as Casino. A man is punched a few times onscreen, his face is completely dripped in blood (shown for a bit). One of the attackers is later shot in the head, we see a bloody bullet wound with blood dripping down shortly.

Several instances of opium smoking, limited to a couple of scenes. Sporadic instances of smoking and drinking. The main characters are involved in the Prohibition business, so pretty much all of the drinking is illegal. All violent scenes are realistically graphic, and the rape scenes are very disturbing. Besides the violence and the intense scenes, this is a very melancholic and emotional film from beginning to end. A teenage prostitute is seen having sex with an older man, but no nudity from her, just the man's bare butt. There are various intense scenes. Cunt is said once during the latter half. 22 uses of ""fuck"", 13 uses of ""shit"", 3 uses of ""damn"", 10 uses of ""ass"", 4 uses of ""pussy"", 3 uses of ""cock"" and a few uses of ""bitch"", ""schmuck"", ""pansy"", ""bastard"", and ""hell"".

A flashback is shown to the original film to a character who appears bloodied in the sea. A bird crashes on a plane's glass. There's some blood shown on the glass but it is very quick and easy to miss. Some mild scuffles between 2 students Maverick's plane overheated and blows up in the beginning of the movie. He ejects and looks worn out, but not seriously injured Adults are seen drunk in a bar while singing ""Great Balls of Fire."" There's a couple scenes where multiple people are seen drinking in a bar. All the sequences of violence are relatively mild as well as the sense of threat. The flashback to Goose's death in the first movie can be emotional. Some scenes feature aircraft crashes or aircraft being destroyed. A pilot, after being ejected, is pursued on the ground by a helicopter that fires a machine gun at him.

Your Name.	PG	7	2	5	0	3	"There are very easy-to-miss panty shots while Taki is in Mitsuha's body when biking up to a mountain to meet her in his body later in the movie, and when tripping while running back to town to make sure everyone is evacuated before the meteor hits. These shots are not meant to be sexual nor suggestive. A girl playing basketball jumps and lands, while her breasts jiggle, the onlooking boys blush in unison. Played for laughs. No nudity. A female character looks at herself in the mirror wearing only her underwear, but there is no explicit nudity. Multiple scenes of one character groping and squeezing her own breasts, this is played for comedic effect. One scene of a male character grabbing his crotch, similarly surprised. A female character in a male body is embarrassed to use the bathroom, and remarks afterward how everything is too detailed. This is played for comedic effect. An umbilical cord is cut. Very little blood is shown. Two characters set up explosives to create an explosion. no drugs. One woman briefly smokes a cigarette. Several older men drink alcoholic beverages together, and one appears visibly drunk. Two characters make kuchikamizake, a type of Japanese sake. One later suggests to the other that she should make and sell kuchikamizake, which she declines, citing the Liquor Tax Law. A character later drinks the kuchikamizake.  The word ""jackass"" and ""hell"" is said in the English dub. No other swearing. Some uses of ""boobs"" and ""boobies."" The word ""dick"" appears once in the subtitles."

Requiem for a Dream	R	7	5	9	7	3	"The main reason that this rating is severe is because of the nudity, in fact there are no sex scenes at all. There are a few scenes where drug deals occur and there are naked homeless people lying around. Although you do not see genitals, it still may be a disturbing but realistic portrait of slums. A woman stands looking at herself in a mirror wearing only a crop top. This is quite suggestive though not graphic. A man's bare backside is seen as he runs towards his girlfriend, also nude. No sex, some non graphic nudity. There is a long sex scene between two characters with full nudity. A man is seen standing naked in the dark. His hip region is barely visible (editorial comment removed, and is reserved for the reviews sections). A woman takes a bath. Nudity not shown. The violence depicted in this movie is not graphic at all but it is very intense because you may not expect it. Several people are shot offscreen, it isn't graphic and is in a dark setting, but a man is briefly seen with blood splatter on his face afterwards. We see two people putting a body in a trash can. This is brief, and from a distance. Some scenes where people engage in fist fights because of a drug dealer. Four people are seen going through intense emotional suffering. The entirety of the movie is centered around drugs, and the horrors that come of it. Marijuana and cigarettes are both smoked a couple times 2 characters want to make it big off of drug dealing Couple brief scenes where a white powder like substance (presumably cocaine or speed) is snorted through a rolled up dollar bill. People doing drugs is actually rarely shown in the movie, it's more about the lives of people using, and how drugs ruin them. It has a great message that everyone should hear. Other pieces of media centred around drugs show a lot more of it. A show such as Breaking Bad shows a lot more drugs. This shows more of the effects and shows how bad drugs are, and that nobody should use. Though drugs are actually rarely shown, the effects of them are. Such as hallucinations etc. It can be quite disturbing and dark but people realise that the hallucinations aren't real. However, ironically, a heroin addicted character (rightfully) discourages a woman from taking speed. The main focus of the film is the development of drug addicted characters. The drug content sometimes ensues disturbing images. The film is extremely depressing and while the movie goes on it just get worse and worse. Some adult themes and drug use. Can be disturbing. R18+ ( Adult Themes & Strong Drug Use ) Some of the characters are sometimes in pain after fights. This isn't graphic or disturbing but might be intense for some. The drug sequences and hallucinations are intense and disconcerting. A woman experiences gloomy and frightening hallucinations, which become worse as the movie continues. Frequent swearing. 33 uses of ""F*ck. Constant uses of ""shit"", ""damn"", ""bitch"", ""hell"". Words such as ""pussy"" and ""ass"" are used very rarely. Some religious profanities: ""goddamn"", ""Jesus"", ""Christ""."

3 Idiots	PG-13	7	3	4	0	4	"At the start of the film, after delivering a baby doctor slaps his butts to make him cry. A single mild reference, for comedic purposes only. Two urinating scenes: 1) A guy warns Rancho ""If you won't came out then I'll piss on the door."" After the count of 10 Rancho shows the spoon to the guy he tries to urinate on the spoon but gets an electric shock on his penis. 2) Chatur tries to urinate on the wall two kids puts a gadget out and the same thing happens. No sex or nudity, but note the following: There is a scene of ragging (hazing) where male students are pulling down their pants to have buttocks stamped. However, no nudity is seen, and it is comic in tone. There is a reference to someone being called gay, and a bit of gay humor (comic in tone, unoffensive). A student slides magazines under the other students' doors to keep them from studying. Only the covers are shown, with women in skimpy clothing. One student is shown stroking his bare chest as he looks at a magazine. An image of man who has hanged himself is shown. Virus beats Rancho to an umbrella and says ""you are a theif"". Minor references to violent actions throughout but nothing very serious and explicit. A man is seen drinking in a scene. A drunk girl visits the boys hostel. Drugs: None There is a scene in which 3 people are seen consuming alcohol and drunk. The scene is relatively extended, but not serious nor is it particularly dramatic in tone.  Speech scene: Balatkar (rape) word was used throughout the speech, stan (breast) word was used 3-4 times and the last moment explaination of farting power in sanskrit. Hindi swears including kamina, saala, gadha and many more. Name calling - (virus, silencer). Words like ass, piss, screw and swine are used. They are infrequent, though."

Uniformed combatants are attacked or killed by large machines' laser fires or are beaten and battered by Ewoks. While punishing somebody, a man is lifted up off his feet by a third party, pulled away from his victim as he grunts, and tossed over some railing into a deep shaft. Screaming as he is falling, he explodes nearer toward the bottom of the shaft. A man briefly fistfights with an enemy before flipping him over his back. The rancor is released from its cage (very grotesque looking) and eats a pig guard. No blood, but the guards body is shown being eaten onscreen. Intense. An Ewok gets killed in an explosion. Jabba the Hutt smokes something. Alcohol is implied to be in Jabba's palace. An Ewok can be seen smoking a pipe. While this is the most lighthearted Star Wars film, it's also one of the most emotional, too. Luke faces-off with the Rancor. Luke and his friends are led to the pit of a giant desert monster to be fed alive. Luke is the first to walk the plank to drop from a small craft, but with his friends in position to help him, he twists and uses the plank as a springboard to jump back and begin the battle against Jabba the Hutt's gang. Emperor Palpatine has a deformed visage look, and he has a creepy voice. No profanity

There are passing moments in which adults behave inappropriately towards children, however, they reject their advances. A woman while at jail and away from her baby and crying squeezes her breasts and some of her milk pours out. A boy removes the clothing of a female statue so her breasts and nipples become visible. Two old homosexual people are working in a park. One of them talks and acts suggestively. Children are occasionally pushed, shoved, and smacked by adults.

Kids are smoking In the first scene Contains themes of child abuse, neglect, poverty, family breakdown, child marriage, drug manufacturing, and bereavement which may cause distress. There is a discreet sequence in which a young boy instructs an 11 year old girl, who has just had her menarche, to put on a sanitary pad, and warns her against disclosing her pubescence lest her parents attempt to marry her off. Contains coarse language throughout (much of which is uttered by a child), including the use of ""fuck"", ""motherfucker"", and ""cocksucker"". The film also contains use of milder terms, including ""son of a bitch"", ""shit"", ""piss"", ""asshole"", ""crap"", ""slut"", ""whore"", and ""bastard"".

A woman mentions that she is ""stoned"" after taking some drugs with her boyfriend. Two people smoke a joint at the edge of a bed. Joel asks Clementine if she wants a drink and then hands her a glass of whiskey. The movie has some very loopy and confusing scenes, these may stress some viewers out. This film is extremely emotional and may make a lot of viewers cry. In a few of the surreal dream sequences we see some people with disfigured faces that can frighten some. But nothing serious and simply because of indicating the scene's surreal nature. Some uses of ""fuck"" throughout with a number of them having sexual meanings, some other language too. One use of ""faggot""."

Reservoir Dogs	R	2	8	3	3	3	"No sex or nudity shown. Only sexual talks at the very begining of the film. There is a few dialogues about the differences between ""how the women act in bed"" The movie follows a gang of criminals before and after a robbery, the killings of cops and civilians are discussed but rarely shown.

His ear also gets cut off, but that is completely offscreen. The victim is then doused in gasoline and threatened to be burned alive Lots of bloody shootings with extended images of bloody wound detail. There is a scene where a man's ear is cut off offscreen but we see the severed ear after before the victim is lit on fire. Alcohol: Infrequent and non to excess Drugs, recreational: verbal reference to Almost every character smokes cigarettes and drinks alcohol. The ear scene could be considered frightening and/or intense Rated R for strong brutal violence, pervasive strong language and some sexual references. Rated R18+ ( Strong Coarse Language & Strong Violence ) 269 uses of ""fuck"" A few racial slurs are used. There are 421 total uses of profanity."

The Hunt	R	7	4	4	4	8	"A teenage boy shows a young girl a video clip that evidently shows a man's erect penis, which the audience briefly sees, and uses a sexual phrase the girl later repeats to an adult who leaps to her own conclusion and spreads devastating gossip.

Hamilton	PG-13	5	5	3	1	13	"Three songs in Act II reference a character's affair. Nothing graphic shown or addressed. Sexual suggestive dialogue is said at various times, some including words like ""intercourse"" and ""deflower."" Hamilton is playfully referred to as ""the tomcat."" The majority of a scene detailing a character's affair is merely narrated, but includes descriptions like ""she led me to her bed/ let her legs spread."" Aaron Burr casually admits to an affair he is having with a married woman. He later has a daughter with her. (Though not depicted in the play, historically he did marry the woman after her husband was killed in war.) Nudity: None The battle scenes are not portrayed as violent as they are only expressed through dance. As the film is of a theatrical production, all of the war and battles scenes are minimally depicted and mostly narrated. Nothing more than blood and wounding are described. No prop blood is ever used. Historically accurate prop guns are used. Shooting is represented only through sound effects and a dancer miming a slow motion bullet. Dueling is established as common (and legal in some situations) and occurs between several pairs of characters, major and minor. No blood when violence occurs, very family friendly At points throughout the film, characters are seen drinking in a bar. Alcohol is seen in glasses during a wedding scene. Hamilton accuses Thomas Jefferson of ""getting high with the French"" during a debate. Smoking: None Strobe lights are used in a few scenes which may not be suitable for viewers who are seizure prone. Swearing infrequently occurs throughout the musical in 3 songs, including abuses of ""Christ"" and ""Jesus."" One of the songs (Yorktown) mutes the use of the 'f' word. There is an implied 'f' word during the song ""Say No to This"" but is never finished being said. Multiple uses of ""sh*t"", ""damn"", ""ass"", ""bastard"", ""hell"" and ""whore"". References to *f***"" are suggested but never explicitly said. One use of ""prick"" meant as an insult. Mild swears including ""damn"" (9 uses), ""hell"" (4 uses), ""piss"" (3 uses), and ""ass"" (2 uses) heard throughout. ""Sh*t"" used 7 times. Hamilton says: Sit down John YOU FAT MOTHER F-*bleep* Several uses of G.D. Two censored F-words in the show, four censored in the movie. Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down): ""When you knock me down, I get the f**k back up again."" Say No To This: ""You see, that was my wife that you decided to fuuuuuu..."" Washington On Your Side: ""Southern motherf***ing democratic republicans!"" We Know (same as Say No To This): ""You see, that was my wife that you decided to f- Whaaaaaaat? Not in all songs, but in a lot, there are a lot of cuss words. Nothing too bad The f bomb is dropped 3 times throughout The words bastard and whore are in the first line of the opening song."

A man falls from a high flying aircraft after jumping through a window and getting tangled. Although the impact is not shown, it is very clear that he dies.

Within the main character's imagination, letters jump off a page and turn into insect-like creatures. At the beginning of the movie, letters and numbers start spreading throughout the screen while the teachers start grading the students, and eventually start making alerting noises, which could startle the viewer and traumatize younger audiences. The first half of the movie shows a kid being constantly berated by teachers, students, and even his parents, which could upset some viewers. 2 uses of bloody Song - Bheja kum - There are lots of taunt words like ""idiot"", ""duffer"", ""lazy"" and ""crazy"" was used throughout the song.

1917	R	1	18	4	6	2	"A guy tell his friend that he can't mastrubate anymore because he cut his hand and the other says that it's not the hand he use. But the was just for 5 sec Not much combat, but some gory aftermath scenes, which can include missing limbs. Some of the scenes in which soldiers are missing limbs can be easily missed, until the end, in which hundreds of soldiers with gory and brutal wounds are scene. Compared to many other modern war films the brutality of war is not focused on as this film as it concentrates on the emotional impact of violence rather than graphic. Though note this film still has its has a few intense graphic scenes. A plane crashes in a very intense but not very brutal scene. There is a war scene, soldiers are seen being attacked by bombs and guns. Two soldiers fight onscreen. There is punching, kicking and choking. It is dark with nothing graphic seen at all. A brief standoff of two soldiers shows one bloody soldier on the ground. Brief moment. A scene across no mans land shows some corpses with bloody wounds. We see a lot of dead bodies with large open wounds on their backs and chests. A scene near the end of the film shows a field hospital with many soldiers with severe wounds. A soldier missing an arm, and several soldiers missing pieces of their legs are shown. Camera does not focus on these injuries, however they are in plain view for 10-15 seconds. While helping a fellow soldier, one gets his hand punctured by barbed wire. Dead and decomposing horses are shown, with accompanying visuals and sounds of swarming flies. Bodies of dead soldiers are shown floating in a river. Several bodies are bloated from exposure to the elements. Majority of the violence in this movie is seen only in aftermath such as rotted corpses, injured soldiers and scattered limbs across the battlefield (No Mans Land) Most of the violence is just dead bodies and wounded soldiers. A body is carried with blood absorbed on a cloth on a dead soldiers eye, implying he was shot in the eye. The film doesn't necessarily focus on the violence, but it is more of a background noise. Their is only one scene of combat and two injuries with both include blood, other than that the film is far more intense than violent. There are some gory wounds during the last 20 minutes, nothing too severe though Many corpses from the war are visible. Lieutenant Leslie is seen smoking a cigarette just as he blesses the two soldiers before they go over the top. A German soldier (only seen from afar) is heavily drunk. A soldier in the troop transporter lights a cigarette. Drugs: None The entire film is made to look like one long continuous take so it's always intense. A lot of the violent scenes are intense. There is a scene where a soldier is being chased by shooting enemies which is quite intense. The music adds to this dramatic atmosphere throughout the movie. Intense violence. However any such gory impact is rarely Seen. Mostly the after-math, some are disturbing containing limbs removed disemboweled and such relative. A bit grissly but brief. Brief shot of a man with a missing leg not disturbing but slightly bloody Very intense film. It keeps you at the edge of your seat at all times. More intense than violent. The main characters rarely actually shoot their guns. 7-9 uses of ""Jesus"", less than 5 uses of ""shit"", a few uses of ""bastard"", a few uses of ""hell"" Around 11 uses of ""f**k"" scattered throughout. However, it is understandable considering it is a war film. Tamer than ."

Downfall	R	2	9	1	2	2	Female Breasts are shown in this film in two scenes briefly. Once scene in a bed. Another scene in a nazi party In the middle of the movie, a man receives a call and is in bed with a woman whose breasts are exposed. In the second half of the movie, a party with Nazi soldiers is shown that had several women with exposed breasts. A man is shown in a room with a half-naked woman whose breasts are exposed. All of these scenes are very brief and non-sexual. Most of the violence takes place offscreen; however, there are instances of graphic violence throughout the movie. Soviet troops attack German positions with sub-machineguns, tanks and infantry. Some of the battle scenes are intense despite there aren't a lot of'em. An old man is hanged, due to the new order that no one should retreat. This scene is fairly intense One man shoots himself in the mouth and blood splats all over the wall. A soldier is shot through the head and blood sprays out. A few other people are shot, but not too graphically. In a make-shift hospital, amputated limbs are seen in a bowl on the floor. Blood is seen everywhere. Many of the main characters shoot themselves and their wives, however this is either done offscreen, or when the camera pans away from the shooting. Shots are heard. The bodies of two characters who shot themselves are carried away while their children look on. The children do not realise what has happened. A character is shot, this is bloodless although we do see the character collapse to the floor. There is heavy drinking during the movie. It is implied that a man is snorting cocaine. Smoking occurs sporadically throughout the film. Hitler's Dog is forced to ingest Cyanide pills as it cries. Disturbing if you are an animal lover. The whole movie is extremely intense, as it's meant to show the horrors of war. The scene where Hitler commits suicide comes out of nowhere and is very disturbing. One scene when a group of children are killed with cyanide pills is the pinnacle of the films disturbing nature. The amputation scenes may be extremely brutal to some (there are two or three but one is off screen). On two of them you can see the surgeon using knives to cut through their arms or legs and since morphine is scarce they did it without any anesthetics (they scream in pain and one screams for his mother). Almost none; a few minor cuss words (since the film is in German, the words can be seen on the subtitles). 2 uses of Nigger/Nigga, 1 use of fuck, and 1 use of s*** intended to be the pronunciation of some German words heard in the film.

Batman Begins	PG-13	4	20	2	7	3	"A little kiss at the end of the film between a couple Batman gives Rachel a photo of a corrupt judge bringing a prostitute into his car to use as ""leverage"" to imprison a mob boss. Rachel's nipples can be seen poking through her shirt fabric a few times throughout the movie. The first is when Batman rescues her from Scarecrow's secret laboratory where she is wearing a thin purple blouse and the second at the end where she's wearing a silk shirt. Two women swim nude in a hotel pool. However, only their shoulders are shown above the water. A man is shot in the back by a corrupt officer and it is implied that his corpse is dumped into the river. There is mentioning of Falcone slashing his wrists while in prison. He is shown with bandages on his wrists. An escaped convict menacingly approaches a woman and child. He raises a knife to strike at them before being stopped. Batman ensnares a corrupt cop and interrogates him in a tense scene, threatening to drop him from a high height. Batman is set on fire by Scarecrow during their first encounter and falls from a high building. A criminal is urinating in a bathroom but then Batman appears behind him and smashes his head against a mirror, knocking him unconscious. Batman attacks a group of fiends. He grabs one man by the arm and uses his gun to shoot an oncoming attacker in the foot. Then he grabs another crook and flies off with him as the crook screams and fires wildly. A lost boy asks a corrupt police officer for help, but the officer pushes him back. Batman falls into a street full of people who hallucinate him as a monster whom they attack. He manages to escape them by shooting a grapple onto a speeding train. As he flies off, one of his attackers hangs on but lets go too late, falling from a great height. Batman battles a troop of Ra's' henchmen. He beats several of them down, and throws another off a balcony before being attacked by the remaining one. They both plummet off the balcony smashing through structures on the way down. The train crash is very destructive and smashes through numerous structures leaving a devastating trail of mayhem in its wake. A burning beam falls on Bruce Wayne, knocking him unconscious. His stomach is later shown with blood on it. Strong Intense Violence but bloodless and non-graphic In the beginning, a young Bruce Wayne, while hiding from Rachel in a boarded up well, ends up falling down the well when the wooden boards break. (He is rescued by his father, and it's implied that he broke or fractured his wrist and/or arm.) Thomas and Martha Wayne are shot in front of Bruce There's a fight between several men in a prison. One's leg is broken. This is not as violent as many larger scale comic book films, this is a small scale crime thriller and even the way the action is shot is just fists flying around with tons of shaky cam, some aspects of a horror vibes throughout though very fake looking In the opening scenes, Bruce's master Ra Al Ghul challenges him to a sword duel on thin ice. We see them fighting and minutes later, Bruce falls through the ice. The Scarecrow's gas spreads across a mailroom which poisons a group of people. (We see them falling to the ground.) In order to get Rachel, poisoned by the Scarecrow's fear toxin, to the Batcave in time to save her, Batman is forced to elude the police in an extended chase over and through the city, which requires considerable property damage and disabling many police vehicles. People drink champagne at a party. One of the criminals in the movie uses teddy bears to ship drugs. There is a scene when a woman is attacked by fear gas, leading her to see her biggest fears When fear gas spreads through the streets, people see terrifying hallucinations and there is a moment in which an infected man bites into another man's head. The sound of screaming and crunching is heard here. James Gordon pleads for backup, but the Commissioner tells him that there is no one else to help him. However, at that very moment, Batman in his Batmobile leaps into the emergency to help. Scarecrow sprays Batman with fear gas. Batman then hallucinates many bats tearing their way out of Scarecrow's mouth. This scene is very creepy and disturbing. There's a scene where Batman sprays Scarecrow with his own fear gas. As Batman interrogates Scarecrow, he hallucinates him as a frightening bat-like demon with a growling voice and black bile coming from his mouth, terrifying Scarecrow. This part is pretty unsettling and creepy. Several intense and frightening scenes throughout. The Scarecrow's voice sounds very menacing and may disturb young children. The first 20 minutes may be emotional. Goddamn 12 uses of hell 7 uses of damn 1 used as goddamn 1 use of shit and asshole ""asshole,"" ""shit"" (mumbled in a car)"

The Father	PG-13	1	2	4	2	3	"This movie has nothing to do with sex and nudity in any kind A man slaps an old man twice on his face and he begins to cry. Gore: None Casual drinking A man and a woman have a glass of whiskey Smoking: None Drugs, recreational: None The entire mood of the film is intense. It deals frankly and honestly with the effects of dementia and uses a disorienting and fragmented narrative. The ending is probably the most hard to watch scene in the whole movie and it definitely will make viewers cry. Two uses of ""fuck off"" as well as inconstant use of the words ""shit"" & ""bastard"". ""Tits"" is said twice in non sexual context. Several uses of the word ""retarded."" 2 uses of bitch, tits, fuck and retard 1 use of shit and bastard"

The Wolf of Wall Street	R	21	6	15	6	18	"Nude female breasts and buttocks are displayed in a strip club. Sex scenes with female nudity. Although there are quite a few scenes. Pretty much every scene is very short and lasts about 5 seconds. An orgy takes place on a plane. Still very comedic. Also it's not too graphic. A man is shown lying nude on his stomach while a woman is about to sit on top of him. It's very comedic and not graphic A woman teases a man though you do not see anything.

A man lays on the couch of a yacht while several women wearing skimpy clothing throw money at him. Not graphic. A conversation about masturbation happens A woman tries to have sex with a man who was on drugs. This scene lasts about 10 seconds and nothing happens. Since a lot of the movie is narrated, when sex scenes occur you can only see some of it. And you don't really hear it. There are quite a few of sex scenes and most of them go on for a very short time. In this movie there a quite a few sex scenes thought they are short and varies in how severe they are. Most are mild. A man and a woman have sex on top of a bed full of money. About 8 nude men are lined up. Not sexual. There's a terrifying storm at sea that nearly capsizes a yacht. Characters fight amongst themselves quite often, with enraged screaming and yelling, and occasional hitting.

Two men smoke freebase crack and behave ebulliently. Characters are shown drinking in a number of scenes. The movie, for the most part, is a dark comedy; as it deals with topics involving criminal activities on the stock market (hence the eponymous title) and associated sex over indulgence and drug addiction. The scene where Jonah Hill almost chokes to death is pretty intense. The scene where the guys hold the butler over the balcony may be frightening to some viewers All of the party scenes involve extremely reckless and dangerous behavior. We see a plane explode right in front of Jordan looking through the window of a ship. He adresses three people died inside and the scene is pretty dark.

Casino	R	5	16	4	5	5	"A man and woman are seen having sex briefly. No nudity at all, all we see is thrusting, and gasping. They're also very sweaty. The woman is later seen in her underwear. A woman takes off her dress. You see her bare backside and the side of one of her breasts (nipple included). This is less than a second. Two scenes which imply oral sex; neither are graphic, and both scenes cut away before anything happens. Women wear lots of outfits that show cleavage. When a woman is changing clothes you see her butt Several dead bodies are shown with bloody bullet holes. They are surrounded by pools of blood. A dead body has a very bloody chest bullet wound. A pimp is beaten, blood on the nose and mouth. A few bloodless punches and pushes. A woman is shot in the head three times. The perpetrator tilts her head to the side and blood is shown coming out of her mouth. A man is shown getting beaten up in an alley. Most of it is offscreen. A car blows up and kills a man inside. A dead couple has very bloody bullet wounds. Two cops shoot a man and we see blood spurts. Blood is shown pooling out onto the side of the road. A man gets briefly injured in a car bombing. Some blood is on his face and his arm is completely burned. A man's hand is slammed viciously with a hammer. Two gangsters are attacked and brutally beaten. Bones in one of the victim's bloodied face are heard cracking as he gets repeatedly hit with metal baseball bats whilst helpless on the ground. The same man's lifeless body is stripped of clothing and thrown into a hole. His brother is screaming and crying throughout the scene. He is then hit on the head with a baseball bat and we see blood gushing out of his forehead. Later we see his entire body also stripped down, and covered in blood and bruises. Still breathing, he is then tossed into the same hole, and the brothers are buried in quicklime. You see the second victim stop breathing once the soil is shoveled onto his face. A man is violently stabbed in the neck with a pen several times (blood briefly squirts in closeup) and then kicked multiple times and stabbed some more around the upperbody, he is offscreen after the first seven stabs. We see the attacker with a bloody pen-holding hand for several seconds. An extremely bloodied and beat up gangster has his head tightened in a vise. It is implied that he was tortured for two days. His eye bloodily pops out of his head for a split-second. Blood briefly spurts from his mouth, running down his cheeks. His throat is then slit with a switchblade (seen from a distance). This scene is graphic and disturbing A man is shocked once with a cattle prod and has his hand smashed a few times with a hammer in close up, he screams multiple times. Blood trickles out of his hand. He has a very bludgeoned wound on his hand and blood is shown on the table. Several shootings, not overly violent, although a few bloody bullet wounds are seen. Two women are included, one is briefly riddled in the chest with bullet wounds and the other is shot in the head a few times with blood dripping out her mouth.

Cocaine is snorted multiple times, including one case in the presence of a child. Alcohol is occasionally drank. People smoke and drink in bars on several occasions. Frequent cigarette smoking. Robert De Niro's character smokes in nearly every scene he is in. The vice scene is one of the most graphic scenes in the film, as a man's head is forced into a vice and is tightened until his eye pops out, then he begs for death. What makes it even more disturbing is that its based on a real event. A rather disturbing scene is when a man finds his daughter tied up to a bed and locked in her room. Joe Pesci plays a very disturbing character who could become violent at any time he's onscreen. Rated R18+ ( Strong Violence & Strong Coarse Language ) The pen scene is rather hard to watch, particularly when the kicking starts, since the attacker is known for hard blows. Profanity throughout each scene. 422 uses of ""fuck"" and most of it comes from Joe Pesci's character One use of ""cunt"" (non sexually) A few uses of bitch and bitches A few N words"

Unforgiven	R	4	14	2	4	1	"Cleavage is shown regularly in the scenes with prostitutes. In a scene, a man explains that someone's genitals were longer than the barrel of a gun he carried- which earned him a crude nickname. In the opening scene, a man and woman are shown having sex with sounds and movement, it is in the dark and both are semi-clothed, therefore no nudity is shown. When they are interrupted, the woman's bare legs are shown as she puts on her dress. The interruption: a man threatening a woman with knife in the brothel. No nudity. Brothels are a major plot device, but is not used as a way to sexualize the story, rather to advance the plot. The violence in this film while brutal, is not overtly or physically gruesome and is more emotionally charged and frightening than much else in their heavy depictions of turmoil and strain in execution. Many scenes are shot in dark lighting, making the blood less visible. A prostitute is cut several times in the face (with bloody results) until a man holds a gun to the head of the attacker. Two brutal beatings. The first one slightly more violent than the other. In both, the victims' faces are bloody. A man's face is seen bloodied for some time. A large gun fight occurs in a bar lots of men killed with some bloody results e.g. a man is shot in the neck blood clouds, a man is shot in the back blood sprays and so on. You see the aftermath of the shootout with a brief close up of a man covered in blood. A man shoots a wounded man moaning in pain(bloody). A man is shot in the head with a shotgun (heard but not seen). A man is whipped on the back (bloody scrapes are briefly visible). We are later told this man died (offscreen) and further on we see his body outside the saloon twice (with a little blood on the shirt). William has a slightly bloody nose after his horse throws him. A horse is shot. The rider has an offscreen broken leg and is shot once in the stomach afterwards with a bloody bullet wound and some blood shown on his hands. A man is killed by a few shots to the chest (bloody). His friends pursue the attacker and shoot back. A man shoots another man as retaliation for decorating the bar with a body (a large bloody bullet wound is briefly seen as he flies backwards from the force of the blast). A man morosely describes his past killings, sometimes in graphic detail. Various people drink whiskey throughout the film. William stops in a saloon where he ends up getting drunk. Two scenes where a man brutally beats another in a self-righteous and sadistic manner. They are both shown to be significantly injured afterwards. The attack on the prosititute may disturb some viewers. Some characters talk about it and add more gruesome, but untrue details to the story. A man is whipped and threatened by another man. We later hear this man died offscreen. A man hallucinates and speaks about seeing men he's killed with graphic detail. 8 uses of ""fuck"", 20 uses of ""shit"", 18 uses of ""bitch""/""son of a bitch"", 35 uses of ""damn""/""goddamn"", 40 uses of ""hell"", 3 uses of ""bastard"", 9 religious exclamations, and 10 uses of ""whore"".

There Will Be Blood	R	3	6	2	1	4	"A scene takes place in a brothel but nothing is seen. A man claims another man has ""lusted after women"". A couple are briefly seen kissing in the background of a scene. Nothing sexual at all. A man injures his leg and has a limp for the rest of the movie. Multiple onscreen deaths throughout the course of the film. There is violence in this film but none of it is bloody or gory violence, and it typically is shown from a far away camera angle taking away from the violence of the scenes A man falls down a hole, landing on his back and groaning in pain. A man is slapped around many times and choked. A boy slaps and punches his father. A man mixes alcohol from a flask with milk and serves it to a child twice. Some smoking and drinking. As the film goes on one of the main characters begins to go crazy and more violent. This can be disturbing to the viewers. Mild usage of profanity. 1 brief use of shit. 1 hard to hear use of ""God damn"". 1 use of the word ass."

The Truman Show	PG	3	2	1	4	1	"A woman tells a man ""Come to the bed."", implying sex There's a kissing scene between two characters. Their is a man in a bath tub but nothing is shown. At one point of the movie, Truman hits his face with something. We see a brief hit on his cheek but nothing so bad. A character holds another at knife point very suspenseful and may be disturbing Truman and his friend occasionally drink beer while contemplating life, and the friend always shows up at Truman's house with a six-pack of beer and his friend makes a statement about it This movie is very dark. This movie may cause paranoia for people after recently watching it. Although it's staged, we see a flashback to when Truman tried to help his father, but then had to watch him drown off their boat during a violent storm. Some suspenseful moments as Truman attempts to challenge the limits of his world: trying to drive over a bridge, driving through a wall of fire, stepping in front of moving traffic, battling a conjured weather storm in a sailboat, etc. At least 2 ""s"" words (with another possible one), 4 hells, 3 damns, 2 asses, 1 S.O.B., and 1 use of ""G-damn"" as exclamations."

There are some mild wounds on his body that show that he was physically harmed. At the funeral of a young girl, a videotape briefly shows a mother feeding her child poisoned soup to keep her sick. A man and woman drink wine and appear a little tipsy. Scenes where ghosts appear can be found disturbing, startling, upsetting, dark, and suspenseful. The behavior of the mentally troubled Vincent Grey (Donnie Wahlberg) is disturbing. A few genuine frights. Eerie atmosphere throughout. The scary bits are so well woven into the story that they are more thought provoking than frightening. A few jump scenes. Some of the entries under 'Violence & Gore' might be disturbing. Bullshit, ass and dick are used once each. Goddamn, damn and hell are used 2 times. Damn briefly seen scrawled on a piece of paper, however they are very easy to miss.

May mutters to be safe (this isn't even in the subtitles), but that was never their intention. A man says ""I'm butt ass naked"", but we only see about mid-torso and up of his body. Multiple scenes of male topless nudity. One scene Spider-Man only wears boxer shorts. Peter and MJ kiss in two scenes Several characters are hit and punched a lot with brief blood detail at times.

Scenes include people fleeing from explosions, falling from heights, and brief jump scares as a lot of different villains appear Despite the film's crowd-pleasing moments and comedic tone, there are several moments where it can be emotional or disturbing. The ending is rather bittersweet. Green Goblin can seem a touch creepy at moments in the movie. His laugh can also seem disturbing. Spider-Man is mostly mad (in a dark way) at green goblin and Some might think it's Frightening There are 5 uses of ""Shit"". There is also an incomplete F-word, and a few uses of ""Ass"", ""Damn"" and ""Hell""."

Shutter Island	R	4	9	4	3	4	"Very clear views of completely nude women in photos/paintings during prison road Full-frontal male nudity (clearly visible for most of the scene) can be seen for around 30 seconds when Teddy is walking by the prisoners. A realistic painting of a nude woman is seen. A patient makes very crass sexual comments about a woman whom he maimed, implying that she wanted to have sex with him and that she wanted to be naked. A man stabs another with a needle full of sedative, this isn't bloody but can be quite shocking When Teddy has a flashback to when he was at Dachau, the American soldiers line up the Nazi guards and open fire on the group. Some blood sprays but not overly graphic. The Nazis are shown being shot as they are riddled with bullets and an overhead shot shows the aftermath. Little onscreen violence, but the aftermaths of many violent acts are shown and they are sometimes quite gruesome. A man shoots another man twice in the chest. Blood sprays onto the wall behind, but it is quite unrealistic, and is very brief. A man looks at paintings of people and various torture devices. In one scene, a man is walking down a Nazi camp as he sees woman and children on the ground covered in blood. Very disturbing. A man commits suicide, his body is later shown with blood all around it and one cheek is mangled from the bullet entering his face. This is the most graphic scene in the movie.I A man face is very bruised and cut up from an offscreen beating. A man jumps out at a person and strangles him, but he grabs him and punches him in the face, until somebody stops him. A man is a recovering alcoholic A man is seen taking pills with a shot of liquor to cure a migraine. People are seen being offered and are seen drinking alcoholic drinks.

Corpses of holocaust victims are shown spilling out of railroad cars. Bloody, dead bodies of children are shown up close. The main character has visions and dreams that become nightmarish. There are several jump scares, some more effective than others. The whole film is incredibly bleak and disturbing, having an unrelentingly grim story as well as an ABSURDLY dark tone. Disturbing images throughout, but nothing too extreme One use of ""nigger."" 19 f words Profanity is pretty infrequent, especially when compared to other Scorsese films like The Wolf of Wall Street, Casino, Goodfellas, The Irishman or The Departed. High number of uses of ""Jesus"", ""Jesus Christ"", ""god damn"""

Jurassic Park	PG-13	2	8	2	5	2	"A throwaway line where a man asks if people are ""auto-erotica"" A man's computer screen is seen with a screensaver of a bikini clad woman. The screen is shown 2-3 times. A man is eaten by the T-Rex onscreen while on the toilet. Not very graphic, slightly comedic. A man is dragged inside a cage and killed by a raptor (offscreen). He screams in agony and we see his pained face. A live bull is lowered into a raptor pen by a harness and viciously devoured by the creatures (offscreen). When the harness is pulled back out, some diluted blood is visible for a few seconds. The bloody leg of a goat is seen after the animal is presumably eaten by a T-Rex. A T-Rex knocks a man unconscious, and we see him with a bloody leg injury.(Flesh and Bone are seen) A T-Rex dispatches a small dinosaur, and begins eating it. some flesh is shown dangling from its mouth. A Velociraptor tackles a man and we see it biting his face briefly. We hear the man screaming in pain offscreen and it is implied he is killed brutally by it. Most of the event is covered by plant foliage. Intense. A battle between velociraptors and a T-Rex ensues. The raptors bite it but the T-Rex proceeds to kill them both. A man smokes constantly throughout the film. Other characters drink occasionally. Alcohol is shown and occasionally consumed. There is quite a jumpy bit when Ellie gets attacked by the velociraptors. It is only scary the first time you see it, as it is unexpected. The second half of the film is comparatively intense and contains several sequences in which many of the main characters are in danger - mainly from dinosaurs in the park. A scene where the T-Rex escapes from the habitat includes one onscreen death and an unseen major leg injury. Children are in danger in the scene but come to no major harm. A scene includes two children who are trapped in a kitchen with raptors hunting them. People are killed by dinosaurs in very gruesome manners, very intense and somewhat disturbing.

Kill Bill: Vol. 1	R	4	18	6	4	3	"Rape is mentioned; but neither the act nor nudity is shown. Sexual Reference(s). No Nudity: only a man, who is in his white underwear . A young (teenage) girl asks if an older man wants to 'screw' her. Men describe the act of sexually assaulting an unconscious woman. Some vulgar slang and sexual references. No nudity or act shown. The movie is about a woman whose child is killed (not shown) and her revenge. There is an animated segment where multiple people are killed. These are done in gruesome ways such as people's body parts exploding and blood spraying. Even though it happens in animation its still violent. The bride rips out a man's eye with her fingers. Graphic, but quick and it's in black and white There is a very bloody fight scene but it is very unrealistic. But still graphic and brutal. The bride fights a 17 year old. In that scene, she takes a floorboard and stabs the girl in the foot and then her head. Her eyes bleed. This is somewhat brutal. The aftermath of a bloody massacre/fight is seen, we see multiple dead bodies with blood and missing limbs. Graphic A woman stabs a man in the stomach. Extremely bloody A woman decapitates a man onscreen. The severed head is shown and a geyser of blood sprays out from the neck. This is graphic. The woman then holds the man's severed head in closeup for many seconds. The Bride kills a woman by throwing a knife into her chest. She then pulls it out and wipes the blood off. This isnt that graphic and only a small amount of blood is shown, but it's still pretty disturbing considering the fact that the woman's young daughter was standing right there when it happened. Before the major fight, the Bride kills other guys in a bloody and graphic fashion with her swords. The Bride kills a man by slamming two doors to crush his head. The impact isnt shown but the sound of his head cracking is heard. The Bride bites on a mans tounge and pulls on it. We hear a ripping sound and then see him lying unconscious on the ground covered in blood. While bloody, it is very stylized, unrealistic, and almost cartoonish. However it is still very graphic Everything in this category is done to bad guys, which makes it not disturbing A woman's arm gets lopped off. She writhes in pain and there's a huge fountain of blood coming out of the stump, which gets everywhere including the camera Extremely brutal violence throughout, although most of it is darkly comedic. Defintely one of the most violent movies of all time In the biggest fight scene, numerous bad guys are hacked up left and right. Although, this sequence is in black and white it is still extremely bloody and graphic and the amount of blood that sprays is outlandish. The main character orders a bottle of sake. A minor is seen drinking excessive amounts of alcohol. Scenes can be found of background characters drinking alcohol and smoking. Contains scenes of alcohol consumption and brief smoking Characters are infrequently seen smoking and drinking. A 17-year-old girl is seen drinking heavily from a bottle in a bar. She slams it down aside scattered empty glasses. The only thing that could potentially disturb viewers is the amount of violence. Not a scary movie There is a lot of graphic violence and brutal kills. R18+ ( Strong Stylised Violence ) The anime segment of the movie is quite intense. The depiction of the murder of a married couple is violent and shocking. Similarly, it seems to have seriously psychologically damaged the daughter. ""Bitch"" is said at least 5 times. One use of ""trash"" in Japanese when a japanese girl uses the word for Ferrari. 16 uses of ""fuck"", 2 uses of ""cunt"", 1 use of ""cocksucker"", and other milder terms like ""bitch"", ""shit"", ""ass"", ""hell"" and ""damn""."

No Country for Old Men	R	5	18	3	8	2	"A man sits on a toilet and his buttocks are seen Nudity in this film is never in a sexual context. A husband and wife are talking on the couch as they watch television, and the man says, ""keep running your mouth like that and i'll take you in the back and screw ya."" He says it as a joke. Almost no nudity in the entire movie. Only one scene where a man is without shirt. He is wearing trousers though. A man is nude in a bathtub, but only his upper body is visible because of his seating position and the camera angles used. This movie contains some intense, highly frightening sequences of violence, in which there are implied deaths and injuries. However, all of this happens very fast but is sitil shocking. These scenes contain blood although rarely any gore. Near the beginning, a man is strangled by another man with handcuffs, resulting in the man's throat slitting and blood squirting. A man is unexpectedly shot in the neck, with lots of blood splattering onto a window, and lots of blood pouring out of the wound, then in the head. Blood also splatters onto a man sitting next to him. A violent crime scene is shown twice. Dead corpses are seen with blood all over them and flies swarming them, the interior of a truck has a dead body inside it with lots of blood on the seats. Two dead dogs are seen with bloody bullet wounds in them. A man is shot in the chest with a shotgun while sitting in a chair, blood pools on the floor around him. A man is shot in the face with a shot gun, we see the bloody bullet wounds in his face and we hear him choking to death on his own blood, we see a little bit of blood squirt out of his neck, it is implied that the perpetrator kills the witness. A man begging for mercy is shot behind a shower curtain, we see blood spray onto the curtain from the killers perspective. A man is killed on screen with a cattle gun, after this blood is seen pouring out of the wound Anton makes his victims call sides of a count to determine if he will kill them or not, He is very Cold and remorseless through the Entire Film. A man is shot in the head with a pistol. A man is seen dead from a gunshot to the head. There's blood on the wound as well as the broken glass the bullet exited through. A man is shot in the shoulder. We later see him removing shrapnel from the wound. A dog is shot with a pistol. The dog whimpers and falls down, dying offscreen. Two men are shot with a pistol. One man is shot in the chest and the other is shot in the head. We can see both bloody bullet wounds. A man's forearm is messily blown off with a shotgun, and dangles by a flap of skin. He then is shot with blood spraying. A man is shot in the chest with a shotgun, and is thrown back by the blast, many bullet holes visible. The floor then pools with blood. A desk clerk is shot offscreen. An empty chair where he was previously sitting is empty making it clear he is dead behind the desk he was sitting at. A man is wounded in the leg with a shotgun. He later dresses his wounds, pulling the buck shot out of bloody holes in his leg. The main theme of the film has to do with stolen drug money. In one scene you see many bags of heroin in the back of a truck. Infrequent smoking and drinking. In one scene a man is shown self medicating by injecting himself with morphine, though this is done to dull the pain of a gunshot wound. Anton Chigurh is an utterly remorseless and unrelentingly evil mass murderer. He's an incredibly vicious and disturbing psychopath who takes lives simply for the sake of killing, and he follows a murderous and nihilistic moral code that revolves around the concept of fate and chance. The depiction of his ruthless sociopathy is extremely realistic and frightening, and every scene involving him is unfathomably scary and nerve-wracking. The tone of this film is very dark and disturbing. The character Anton Chigurh will frighten viewers whenever he is on screen. Additionally, the movie has almost no soundtrack and it makes the film even more unsettling. The violence in this film is also realistic and tends to occur suddenly. The lack of audible score adds to the uneasy and tense atmosphere throughout the more intense moments. The goriest scene is towards the end where a man is shot we see blood quickly spray and then the scene cuts to later we see the man who was with him with his shirt with blood on it Moderately disturbing, we see people shot with blood spray A man is shown with blood on his shirt after being with a man who was shot Anton Chigurh is a terrifying villain and Javier Bardem's performance makes him all the more harrowing. The movie centers around a nihilistic psychopath who kills almost everyone he encounters, deciding some of their fates with a coin toss as he pursues a disturbed Vietnam War veteran with a suitcase full of money coming from a drug deal gone awry. Every single encounter with this character is extremely intense, frightening and nerve-wracking. PG-13 level profanity 3 uses of ass, 2 uses of ""fuck"", and 1 use each of ""shit"", son of a ""bitch"", ""whores"", ""dick"", and ""riding bitch"", along with 1 use of ""screw"" (sex). Also 6 uses of ""hell"", 3 uses of ""Goddamn"", 2 uses of ""damn"""

His body is shown writhing in the air. One man kills multiple others with knives in quick succession in several scenes. Lots of blood is shown. The violence is very infrequent, the movie is more of a drama than an action movie. Most of the violence happens at the end. A man goes on a murdering spree and slashes, stabs and throws knives at multiple men. Very bloody but it looks very fake and unrealistic A young woman is stopped in an alley by three men who intend to rape her. A man is knocked to the floor and police place a bag over his face.

Homosexuals, lesbians and minorities are shown being detained and tortured inside state-sponsored concentration camps. The scene in which Evey receives letters from a lesbian inmate may be emotional and upsetting to some viewers, especially if they, too, are empathetic people. The film has a cold and ruthless dystopian setting akin to George Orwell's novel 1984, where the United Kingdom is ruled by a brutal white supremacist, Nordicist and neo-fascist totalitarian dictatorship that has taken control of the land. The main villain is a ruthless dictator and a complete psychopath who brutally murders his opponents, and this may all be upsetting for some. The film also has a brutal and grim atmosphere. The ending is very emotional. It also leaves the viewer with a grim reminder that governments should not be trusted too much. Occasional Holocaustic imagery. Mass graves, torture, human testing, etc. A man threatens to have a woman killed by firing squad. A woman is arrested and tortured for information. A man is shot multiple times, later removing his armor to reveal his bloody chest. He bleeds to death in another character's arms, this is emotional and may upset viewers.

Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels	R	5	14	4	3	7	"A scene where a pornographic magazines are visible. Some sexual jokes. A discussion about ""arse intruding"" dildos takes place. There is a scene where there are dildos in an office. During a scene where a a man is talking to two other men, a naked stripper is seen in the background and out of focus. A character tells another character a story about how a character killed one of his subordinates with a dildo (named by the character as, ""a 10-inch rubber cock.""). (The scene cuts between the guy who's telling the story, and the guy beating the other guy with said dildo. Not graphic.) A woman use a loaded machine gun to shoot a man and fill a room full of bullets. She is slapped by another man right after. A man kills another man with a thrown hatchet. The violence, although graphic, is predominantly comedic in tone, played for ironic, over-the-top humor. A massive gun battle takes place just offscreen. There is a lot of loud gunfire, and a witness gets a little blood splattered on his face. In two scenes, we see the aftermath, and there are many dead and extremely bloody bodies all over the room. Two men are shot and killed (blood splatters), another has a hatchet thrown into his back, and a fourth man is then shot. Several men are shot with an air gun, but not seriously hurt. Another man is passed out on the floor in front of them, and his toes are blown off (offscreen, but we see the bloody results a few times, as well as the man screaming in agony).

A man hits golf balls off another man's face, and hits a man who is tied up, gagged, and hanging upside down.

Three of the main characters are marijuana dealers, so several scenes take place in an apartment where they are growing weed and smoking it. Eddie's dad, JD, owns the local bar where the boys hangout, so there are several scenes involving alcohol and them getting drunk/smoking. The plot revolves around weed. Harry is seen getting ready to snort a pile of cocaine, although he never actually does on-screen. A lot of swearing, blood and gore. Not suited for minors. Constant threats, beatings, etc. While intense, the film is very lighthearted. 2 uses of ""cunt"". Many uses of the slang term ""bollocks"". Men swap jokes which are obviously offensive, though the punchlines are not heard. 130 uses of ""fuck"".

The Secret in Their Eyes	R	10	12	5	1	4	"A man takes out his penis and shows it to a woman. This is shown very clearly. The breasts on a dead girl are shown a handful of moments or so (sometimes close, sometimes distant) as well as once in her pubic region from a distance. A rape scene (please see the Violence/Gore category for more details) shows the bare back of a man as he kneels over a woman in a bed, he pulls his pants down below bare buttocks, rips away the woman's tank top to reveal her breasts and abdomen, and we see thrusting motions, as the woman groans and cries; later we see the crime scene where the woman is shown badly scraped over her entire body and she is almost entirely nude (we see her lying on her back with her genital area covered with a sheet corner, and her panties down around one ankle). A man and a woman embrace lightly twice and kiss very briefly once. A female court officer states that vaginal penetration in a rape case was very deep. Throughout the film, instances of unrequited love are mentioned in conversations: loveless marriages, high school crushes, a man widowed early in marriage and never remarrying, and an older court counselor in love with a younger, married female court supervisor; one male character states several times that no one can abandon his or her passion. A comment is made about a high school boy that seems to look at a high school girl often and with passion in his eyes, as if he is in love with her.

In a rape scene (please see the Sex/Nudity category for more details), a man rips away a woman's top and rapes her: her face is bloody, forehead to chin, and in a flashback we see the man pick her up in his arms and drive her head into a wall (we see no marks or blood); we later see the crime scene, where the woman is shown badly scraped over her entire body and she lies on her back and her face is bloody. Several black and white photographs of a rape and murder victim's face are seen throughout the film -- about 5 times. A man asleep in a living room armchair at night wakes to loud knocking at the door, three men enter, the man goes into the bedroom, sits on the bed and we see one of the other men shoot at the bed with an automatic rifle several times, pause, and fire one last time: we later see the man on the bed dead, a gaping wound in his forehead and several in his chest, with dried blood covering his face, chest and right arm. A man strikes another man in the face with a crowbar (we see no damage but this is shown twice), forces the second man into a car with him, and drives to an isolated area by a railroad track, stands outside the car and when a train comes, walks to the car trunk, opens it, and fires a gun into what appears to be the body a man (shown 3 times). A suspect is chased through crowded soccer stands, he hides in a men's restroom, jumps out at one man who was chasing him, slams him back against a wall, runs away, police join the chase, he jumps over a wall, injuring his leg, stumbles onto the field, is struck by a running player, falls (he has a bloody face), and is surrounded by barking dogs and police carrying nightsticks. Two men are found in a dark and dirty jail cell, sitting on the floor: their faces, arms and wrists are covered in blood, welts and bruises from having confessions beaten out of them, and another man shouts and runs toward the warden and is restrained by guards. A man in an elevator with two another man and a woman pulls out a handgun with a flourish, loads a magazine, and places the gun into the waistband of his trousers as the woman trembles and the other man seems angry.

The Bridge on the River Kwai	PG	4	5	1	4	1	A kissing scene. There is a calendar in the Japanese commander's hut with an American lady on it. As the months progress her clothes get more inappropriate.She is wearing a bikini in one image A small boy in a tribal village is seen naked from the waist down, his penis is barely visible. But this scene is not explicit in any way. No sex or adult nudity; the closest the film comes to this is bare-chested men. Two men try to escape, both are shot and they die. A character is slapped and characters are mistreated and tortured by Japanese soldiers. Some mild scenes of fistfights and arguments shown. Some mild war violence. Blood is visible several times throughout the movie, most notably when a man is wounded in the foot and after some men are killed in the river. The Japanese colonel is implied to commit suicide if the bridge isn't completed on time. Two characters share a drink in a couple scenes. Relatively intense throughout. Early in the film, a few characters attempt to escape the prison camp at night time but are shot and killed, one falls off a ledge and another is wounded but survives. The climax is intense. The ending can be tragic to some. None.

Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri	R	3	7	3	3	1	"The film contains some verbal references to sex. Man and women kiss, she implies she enjoyed having sex with him earlier(no sex scenes or nudity in the movie, only dialogue) A man and woman have intercourse off-screen. This movie is quite violent but the main issue is the depressing thematic material throughout. A woman kicks two high schoolers (one boy, one girl) hard in their crotches. A man throws an IV of blood against a wall resulting in a small bloody splash. A man suffering from cancer coughs some small spots of blood onto a woman's face by accident. We briefly see photos of a severely burned corpse of a murder victim. Graphic references to sexual assault. A police officer beats up a man with a pistol and tosses him out of a window while some woman in the building is screaming in anger. The police officer punches the screaming woman in the face. The film contains some verbal references to illegal drug possession. Drinking and smoking regularly throughout the film. Someone asks Mildred if she has done drunk driving; she says, ""Maybe once."" This film is very heavy. It revolves around a woman who lost her daughter to a rapist and it is mentioned that she was burned alive. She then decides to put up Billboards that say the police aren't doing their jobs, which drives the whole town into anger, and hatred. Other dark elements are explored such as a man dying of cancer, suffering from the loss of a child, rape, domestic abuse, depression, on screen depiction of suicide and violence. A woman drills a tiny hole through a man's nail in self-defense. The film has many moments that are played for dark humor, but are still intense. Non-stop swearing throughout. 100 uses of ""fuck""; a few of the uses are sexual. 2 uses of ""cock""; both are used in a sexual manner. 4 uses of ""cunt"". Use of homophobic and racial slurs.

Trainspotting	R	5	4	8	4	2	"Renton's bare buttocks are briefly shown in one scene. A man and a woman have sex on TV for about 5 seconds. Most of the graphic sexual content takes place in one extended montage of multiple couples having sex. A scene shows a short montage of different people having sex, during this you see full frontal female nudity and male nudity, but it isn't prolonged. One of the only scenes of sexual content. There is a fleeting glimpse of Kelly Macdonald's dark pubic hair. This occurs as she is seen putting her dress back on after sex. Kelly's hairy triangle is seen literally for a fraction of a second. Begbie is shown destroying a hotel room in a fit of rage. No one is seen being hurt. Despite being somewhat infrequent, the violence 'Trainspotting' does have is very strong. A bar fight occurs In which numerous punches are thrown but this is brief. A man is cut in the hand by a knife, we briefly see the wound. This is very bloody. Renton and Dianne smoke hashish in Renton's flat The film is about drug addiction. Characters are shown drunk or getting high because of drugs. There are frequent depictions of the characters preparing drugs, including scenes of them heating the drugs over a flame, tying their arms with belts and injecting the drug into their veins. While such scenes are frequent, the film does not promote or glamourise drug abuse. There are a few drug induced hallucinations in the film as well. All characters smoke and drink and several scenes take place in bars. A character shoves a Morphine suppository up his anus and accidentally defecates it into the toilet and has to retrieve it by going into the toilet, which leads to an oddly fantastical sequence in the toilet waters. Trainspotting has many disgusting and uncomfortable scenes even though it is a dark comedy. Renton experiences bizarre hallucinations during heroin withdrawal, including a baby rotating her head 180 degrees as she crawls across the ceiling. Many consider this to be one of the scariest non-horror movie scenes. The violence is brief, but it can be shocking. The treatment of a transvestite may be off-putting. Renton inserts a Morphine suppository into his rectum to help with the withdrawal symptoms while he is trying to detox from heroin. However severe diarrhea is a common symptom of opiate withdrawal and he accidently defecates the suppository into a filthy toilet that is already full of feces. He then proceeds to reach into the toilet and starts feeling around trying to find the suppository among all the feces. He is then seen pulling himself into the toilet and swimming around. (the latter half is a hallucination) Pervasive language 142 uses of ""F-word"". 23 uses of ""c*nt"". Pervasive use of ""sh*t"", and ""piss""."

One man offers another a bottle of alcohol, but is declined. A man drinks liquor from a bottle in front of a recovering alcoholic. All of the MMA fight scenes are extremely brutal, especially the final fight. The movie has an overall dark and emotional tone.

Gran Torino	R	3	7	4	4	2	"Some sexual references and references to rape In the background of a scene, a man looks at a picture of a scantily-clad woman. Very brief and not too noticeable. A beaten and bruised woman is shown. It is later said she was raped. The act is never shown, though and neither is any nudity. Nothing super graphic, but there is gang related violence periodically A character trips over and blood is seen on the floor. A man occasionally coughs up blood due to illness. A man is burned in the cheek with a lit cigarette by a gang of thugs. A gang drive-by shooting riddles a house and one character is wounded in the neck. A man is dragged out of his house and he is kicked and punched. You can see bruises and he is bleeding. He is then held up at gunpoint. Most of the violence occurs offscreen and when we do see it, it is dark and most of the visuals can be missed.

He is seen coughing up blood a few times. Neighbours attempt to slaughter live chicken, not shown but implied chicken was killed. The film can be intense throughout due to the fear that violence will erupt or characters may be hurt in stand-off, gang-related scenes. The scene on the lawn is quite intense. Several scenes of characters pointing guns at each other as well as some scenes of shootings. Slurs for African Americans, Italians, Polish, Hispanics, Jews, Indians, Asians and homosexuals are heard throughout the movie. 80 uses of ""fuck"". 23 uses of ""bitch"", 1 use of ""bastard"", 30 uses of ""ass"", 22 uses of ""hell"", 10 uses of ""damn"", 7 uses of ""pussy."""

Fargo	R	5	5	1	6	2	"A woman's bare bottom is seen as she runs down a hallway naked. Very brief. A sex scene is shown for about 6 seconds, in which both characters are fully nude, but the camera is mostly on the mans backside. A few non-graphic and very brief sexual remarks and said. Two men and two women have sex in the same motel room. The scene only lasts about 10 seconds. A fully nude man is thrown over the couch (genitalia and buttocks are shown.) Though much of the violence occurs offscreen, it is still often shocking and sudden. Most of the victims are innocent. Almost all of the violence is through shootings some of them are even oddly funny due do the unrealistic amounts of blood that come out. A couple are killed after witnessing the cop shooting. After crashing their car, the man is shot in the back while trying to run away (no blood is shown). The woman is then shot offscreen while pinned in the car. While having sex, a man is attacked violently. He is kicked on the floor, and then whipped and strangled with a belt. During this attack, a man is slammed against a wall to the point of unconsciousness, and a woman is kicked in the back. A man is shot in the back of the leg while running from the cops, with a little blood on the wound. Some random characters are seen drinking in pubs/bars. One of the kidnappers smokes many cigarettes. Many intense scenes. One involves a home invasion and kidnapping. Some intense scenes include police search of suspicious criminals, a brief car chase, running from peril, shootings, and dangerous encounters. The two thugs may frighten viewers, especially one who is heavily implied to be a psychopath; he rarely talks and does almost all the killing with relative pleasure and no hesitation. Although there is a good amount offbeat comedy with the exaggerated Minnesotan accents and some situations the characters get into, the violence is played seriously and never meant to be funny. Rated MA15+ ( Strong Violence, Coarse Language & A Sex Scene ) The wood chipper scene is the most graphic in the movie. Almost all uses of 'fuck' are said by Steve Buscemi's character. 73 uses of ""fuck"", 5 uses of ""goddamn"", 7 uses of ""shit"", 14 uses of ""Damn"", 2 uses of ""son of a bitch"", 1 use of ""Hell"", 4 uses of ""ass"" (3 used with hole)."

Prisoners	R	4	8	3	3	3	The word porn is said once but is never spoken of or mentioned again. This is neither sex nor nudity. Not at all This film is 100% nudity-free.

Million Dollar Baby	PG-13	1	6	1	3	5	"The ring girls are very scantily clad.

The last half of the movie is extremely depressing. Some of the boxing scenes involving injuries are quite intense. Fixing the broken nose is particularly gruesome.

Paula smokes around 5 times, while various miscellaneous people smoke in various scenes (1 with a cigar). The film has a tense atmosphere. Carl approaches Frank's room with his gun drawn and then holds it on him (although not played for true suspense). There are several intense scenes and narrow escapes. 1 f-word is used.

Gone Girl	R	5	5	5	4	9	"A couple has a conversation in the shower so that nobody can hear them. Their butts are shown as well as the woman's side breast and the man's penis briefly. Not too graphic. A man and a woman kiss passionately in a hallway. They go to a couch and she removes her shirt, revealing her breasts for about five seconds. The scene ends before anything else happens. Nick performs oral sex on Amy under a blanket Nick is seen thrusting into Amy from behind they make sounds like sexual moaning while Amy is in her underwear and nick is fully clothed but he unbuttons his shirt partially There are several sex scenes throughout the movie. There is an implied sex scene that has some breast nudity. The rest include various positions like missionary and cunnilingus, and contain thrusting and panting.

A woman shoves her husband and he violently throws her into a stairwell banister. This is very violent and shocking. There are some graphic references to rape and abuse.

Amy, Greta, and Jeff smoke cigarettes. A scene takes place in a bar where the main character drinks in the morning. People drink at a house party. Characters are seen drinking alcohol, including wine and champagne, at a dinner party Nick and his sister are seen drinking frequently. Disturbing thematic material and overtone, and the sudden bursts of violence can be frightening. Some emotionally intense moments, including crying and yelling. It portrays sensitive themes of murder, infidelity, and manipulation. This film constantly leaves you in suspense and is also a diaturbing film. The mindset of some of the characters in the film could be seen as disturbed and aberrant. 'F*ck' is said 49 times. 'B*tch' is said several times.

The Grand Budapest Hotel	R	10	6	1	2	6	"A very brief shot of a woman covering her breasts with her hands, this is easily missed At the beginning of the movie there is a montage of the owner of the hotel talking to his guest most of these scenes are just him talking but two of which show him sitting in bed with a elderly topless woman (breasts exposed), and the other shows him looking at himself in a mirror with a woman performing oral sex. A man sprays water on a naked man where his back and is upper part of his buttocks is shown. The frame last for only a couple of seconds. A painting of two nude women kissing while holding each other's breasts and rubbing each other's genitals is shown. Breasts, nipples, and thick pubic hair are clearly seen. Their actual genitalia is also somewhat visible. Not overly graphic due to the painting's somewhat abstract nature. However the nudity is pretty clear and it is pretty evident what the women are doing. The painting is shown in multiple scenes. A scene with black and white pin up photos of women in the background. Breasts and nipples are seen on all of them and some of them show the women's pubic hair. The photos are in the background of the scene, and relatively small, but they are in focus and pretty easy to see. All nudity in the film is shown in brief glimpses. It is only breast nudity, with most of them in a non-sexual context. The sexual content in the film are not graphic and are also brief, including fellatio and post-coitus. There are non graphic black-and-white paintings of naked women in the background of some shots. There are naked statues. A man says a woman is like dynamite in the sack Some remarks about a man being a predator Brief shot of man and a woman kissing in bed.

Many people get punched, often leading to bloody noses and bruises. A cat is thrown out of a window. The cat is seen spread-eagle on the pavement in a bright red splat of blood. We see a bloody bag with the dead cat in it later on. The effect is cartoon-like rather than gory. A shootout between many characters ensues; no one is hurt and the scene is meant to be humorous. Most violence and gore is comical rather than horrific. A woman's severed head is pulled out of a basket. People socially consume alcohol. A man is seen smoking. A cat gets thrown out a window All violence is portrayed in a comedic tone (the movie is not dark) Probably the most profanity of Wes Anderson's movies. Most profanity is used in anger Homophobic slurs like ""faggot"" ""candy ass"" and ""fruit"" are used about twice each by one character ""Fuck"" is used sexually a number of times. 17 uses of ""fuck"" A few uses of ""shit"", ""ass"", ""damn"", and ""hell"". 2 uses of ""faggot"" Name-calling and several stereotypical references to ethnic groups."

In the Name of the Father	R	7	6	4	2	1	Gerry and a girl kiss exchanging the smoke of a marijuana cigar. Gerry's father, Giuseppe, is also seen naked in a brief moment.

A prison guard is squirted with lighter fluid and then is set on fire. He stumbles around seeking help while prisoners watch him burn. Street riots are very violent in their nature.

A man is disturbed and knocked out of his bath, but all private parts are covered by soapy water. A husband and his wife give each other a morning kiss Several brawls which include sight of mild violence and use of weaponry. Some slapstick. A woman slices open a fish. Its innards can clearly be seen. Drugs: None Smoking: None The town is initially a rather dark and, even, scary place. The residents are in the middle of a fight between two clans. The fights are cartoonish and no actual violence can be seen. Sight of knives, spears and other weapons. An implied dead body is seen being carried twice. Klaus initially seems threatening. The protagonist fears for his life (eg. worrying about being sliced into little pieces and thinking he is holding a severed head). Some scenes that are quite dark in nature but have a comedic overtone and will probably go over children's head, for example 2 people are seen carrying a bag in the shape of a body and a shoe falls out of it, suggesting that someone is inside the bag (this happens twice) God as blasphemy The words ""loser"" ""brat"" ""stupid"" and ""idiot"" are all mentioned throughout the film."

Hacksaw Ridge	R	3	18	2	6	2	"A man does pull ups nude. His butt is seen for several seconds but no frontal shots. One of the soldier is proud of his physique and works out nude, brief glimpses of his backside are shown. A couple references are made by the other men about his anatomy. The Sargent then proceeds to force him to train nude as well until he has completed the training that day A soldier is reading a magazine about women. We see the cover of the magazine, which depicts a topless woman, however we do not see her breasts. This is very brief, only a second or two. The battle scenes are very graphic, realistic, and absolutely spine chilling to watch. They are long, and filled with bloody gunfire, graphic stabbings with knives and bayonets, and lots of gruesome explosions which separate limbs and leave blood everywhere. It has tons of guts, limbs, intestines, and tons of blood everywhere. In the very first Hacksaw scene at Okinawa, one of the soldiers is shown with his legs blown off. Bloody strings of fat and muscle are shown protruding from his legs as he is dragged to safely. His femur and tibia bones are shown for several seconds The kickstart of the very first Okinawa battle scene, one of the soldiers is slowly crawling through the war-torn battlefield. Suddenly, a wounded soldier rises from the rubble and starts screaming in terror in front of the soldier. A gunshot is heard and the screaming soldier takes a bullet to the back of the head, splattering brain matter all over the face of the soldier. Then they are both ripped apart with bullets. Very graphic, not for most viewers. Probably the most violent the movie gets The main character is very close to a grenade explosion and is flung backwards. His legs and thighs are shown bloodied and burned. Not too intense. Not exactly a spoiler as this is briefly shown in the very beginning of the film In the beginning there are soldiers being burned alive by flamethrowers and in the midst of explosions and others being shot during the combat of war A boy hits another boy in the head with a brick while they are fighting A man has his leg crushed by a car which gives him compound fracture and causes blood to spurt out of his leg A man smashes a glass bottle on a tombstone as a result his hand bleeds on the tombstone from his wound A man throws a knife into another man's foot A man punches a man in the face in order to instigate a fight and test him A group of men beat up a man which results with the man bloody and bruised Soldiers being riddled with bullets through torsos, legs, and heads with blood spurting out. Explosions from grenades, mortars, and RPGs that cause some lost of limbs and tissue damage. Soldiers being stabbed/bayoneted and beaten up with fists. Soldiers are burned alive with flame throwers and exploded by them as well. Some soldiers are decapitated and commit suicide with self stabbing and kamikaze attacks. There are soldiers dead on the ground with intestines strewn out and missing limbs on the ground which also on some bodies have rotting flesh with maggots and rats feeding off of the bodies Body parts are shown being blown off throughout each battle scene. A man is seen drinking whiskey from a bottle during the day. He is later described as being an alcoholic. Some soldiers smoke cigarettes. (Realistic) There is a fistfight between two brothers, which takes a dark turn when one of the brothers smashes the other over the head with a brick. The brother is immediately knocked out, and it is implied that he might be dead. There is a scene where a father is beating his wife and threatening her with a gun. His son comes in, takes the gun from him and points it at his father. This scene could prove to be disturbing to some viewers. This movie is more violent than saving private ryan The movie portrays the horrors of war as it is, and does so realistically.

Wild Tales	R	3	2	1	2	2	"There is a make out scene between a man and a woman. They kiss passionately; sex is implied. No nudity is shown. A man's buttocks are visible for perhaps 10 seconds as he defecates on a windshield. A man and a woman start kissing. They begin having sex, thrusting from the side is shown, however the scene is brief as they are soon interrupted. The man's buttocks are briefly seen as he pulls his trousers up. A man pushes another car off a cliff. A man tries to run a car over another man, but his car also falls off a cliff. A few scenes show people drinking. ""Relatos salvajes"" is a black comedy. Children could easily be frightened by quite a few scenes; some parts of the movie may be intense even for certain adults. 3 utterances of ""God."" Also, someone twice says, ""Madre mia, madre de mi Corazón,"" which literally means, ""My mother, mother of my heart""; this is (erroneously) translated ""Holy Jesus"" each time in the English subtitles. 10 instances of the 'f' word (once or twice in a sexual context), 4 of the 's' word, 4 of ""hell,"" 3 of ""damn,"" 1 of ""prick,"" 2 of ""pussy,"" 7 of ""a**,"" 1 of ""crap,"" 1 of ""screwed,"" 2 of ""bastard,"" and 5 of ""bitch."""

Room	R	8	4	0	2	2	"A woman is in the shower. We see her silhouette behind the door. A woman takes off her pants (viewers cant see anything but hear moaning in the background) Ma and Jack are seen in the bathtub together, we see bare shoulders and bare legs. A woman's nipples are discernible through her shirt in several shots. A woman is dressed but braless, and without a bra, the shapes of her breasts are noticeable. A young boy is seen frequently in his underwear. In one scene his mother removes his wet underwear. No nudity is shown. There is no male or actual female nudity. Male captor comes into Room at regular intervals, rips and rapes his female captive. This is seen through the viewpoint of her boy in the wardrobe peeking through the slats. We only see captor removing his jeans, in his underwear, nothing more. Occasional moans from 'Old Nick' (her rapist and captor) are heard. In the scene Ma makes Jack pretends that he is sick, she sticks her fingers down her own throat and we see vomit on Jack's pillow. A boy sees a woman lying on a bathroom floor unconscious from an apparent suicide attempt. Sexual violence is heavily implied but never shown on screen. In one scene, Old Nick chokes Joy after she tries to protect Jack from him. There are bruises seen on her neck the next morning.  The premise of the film itself is highly disturbing, with a woman being forced to raise a child in a confined space after being kidnapped. Ma is raped on a regular basis, and she hides Jack in a wardrobe whenever Old Nick visits so that he does not have to see what he does to her. When Jack leaves the wardrobe and wakes up Old Nick, Ma panics and attempts to shield Jack from him, Old Nick responds by choking her and threatening to murder her. 10 uses of ""fuck"" 4 uses of 'God' and 3 uses of 'Jesus'"

Mad Max: Fury Road	R	3	11	1	2	2	People are implied to be kept as sex slaves, but this is never shown, just said. They are scantily clad throughout the movie. Some large women are seen hooked up to milking machines. Their breasts are briefly seen but not their nipples. In a long shot, a nude woman crouches on top of an old electrical tower, wailing and when she stands we see full side and back nudity (in profile), then a brief glimpse of full nudity as she slides down a rope. Very brief and not meant to be sexualizing. There are several instances of gun violence. A woman wounds a man with a double-crossbow, sending a long dart right below the man's eye and through to the back of his head and another bolt into his chest with some blood flow; the wounded man jumps off a tall vehicle and slams two spears into another vehicle, which explodes and presumably kills him. We briefly see a chainsaw cut into a man, with some blood spraying. People get ran over by huge cars countless times throughout A brutal brawl breaks out between three main characters, they are pistol whipped and tackled to the ground. A war boy is pistol whipped in the face with blood spurts. The violence is almost completely bloodless until the last 30 minutes, where blood and gore become much more frequent. A man is shot from a far distance. We later see that both of his eyes got shot. Blood is all over his wounds. Very violent bloody gory Though actual gore is kept to a minimum, there are frequent scenes of violence and very long vehicular chase scenes. These include scenes where people fight or are shot. However, injury detail is very limited. Many people are shot but it cuts before the actual gore is seen. But sometimes it is seen. Several of the mechanics/war boys spray their faces with spray paint and you can see they are affected by this like a drug. Similar to huffing. A good half of this film are intense car chases, this isn't even exaggerated The film features numerous intense, crazy car chases that host scarred, disfigured, and unnatural individuals. The dark, twisted themes of survival, preservation, and violence are lightened by the presence of slight comic relief and over-the-top action. The movie is half action and half thriller, most of the villains look disfigured and therefore creepy. The film is very intense because it is basically one long car chase and will keep its viewers on the edge of their seats. At least one use of fuck but all strong language is said over loud crashes and explosions, making them very hard to hear. A couple of uses of bollocks and schlanger

How to Train Your Dragon	PG	2	6	1	4	1	"A man gives his son a helmet he says was made from his wife's (the son's mother's) breastplate. He then states that the helmet he is wearing was made in the same fashion and that the two helmets are a matching set, implying that the helmets had been the two cups of the breastplate. Two brief kiss scenes A large dragon eats another small dragon (a Gronkle). This accounts for one of the three deaths in the entire film, the other main one being the Red Death itself/herself when Hiccup and Toothless take it/her down into an explosion. A third, minor death (one Zippleback) occurs shortly after the Gronkle's death, in the same way the Gronkle died. When Hiccup attempts to demonstrate how his bolas cannon works to Gobber, it malfunctions. Gobber dodges it and the item the cannon shot out flies through the window and hits another Viking outside. The first time Astrid says ""That's for x, and that's for y,"" she knocks Hiccup to the ground and thumps the butt of her axe on Hiccup, presumably on his stomach. Astrid has a running gag of punching Hiccup in the shoulder before negating it with a corrolary nice thing to say. A sheep is killed in the beginning There are several action sequences involving warriors in combat with dragons, mostly dodging the dragons' attacks. Some mild violence with crude weapons which mostly end up hitting inanimate objects. No blood ever shown. One character talks about his dragon conquests which cost him body parts. He has a false foot and a hook for a hand. Dragon violence involving breathing fire. Viking drink from large mugs in celebration, implying beer or ale. The movie starts with dragons attacking a village at night. Dark scene with fire and explosions. Fighting with/defending against large dragons in an enclosed arena. The Night Fury roars at Hiccup, while Hiccup looks away. This is unexpected and this is mostly like a jump scare. Toothless brings Hiccup and Astrid to the dragons cave, inside there is a big hole where the dragons are dropping food in it, a gigantic dragon jumps out of it and eats one of them, this could be scary to some kids. Towards the climax of the movie, Stoick says that ""all hell is gonna break loose""."

The Big Lebowski	R	15	7	4	3	1	"The Dude shades a notepad revealing a doodle of a penis and testicles on a piece of paper. It's a doodle and not flesh and is mild. A scene where characters watch a few seconds of an adult film on a small screen. One woman is in very revealing clothing, and one of them is fully nude (you see her breasts for like half a minute, then 2 characters make out.) A woman bounces on a trampoline. Breasts are briefly shown and it is in the background and it's blink and you'll miss it. A woman is forward in a meeting with the ""Dude"" discussing sex and making a reference to the male anatomy (penis). A woman is hoisted on a harness whilst creating a painting. She is then seen shirtless from a distance for a bit. A woman in a bikini asks a man to blow on her toes to dry nail polish, she then says she will give him a blow job for $1,000. No sex or nudity. There is a brief discussion about a character who is a registered sex offender and the time he did in prison. According to Walter, said character exposed himself to an eight-year-old and was forced to inform everyone in his neighborhood before moving in. One of the main characters works at a porn studio, so there are some scenes that take place there. A scene in which she arrives there shows her topless from far away, but breasts are still briefly visible There are several close up scenes of a topless woman sitting crossed-legged as she floats upward off the screen. All nudity in the film is for comedic purpose and is not really to be sexual or provocative. Multiple instances of brief breast nudity and sexual humor, but other than that fairly clean No pervasive scenes of nudity, only a few female topless scenes---which are all notably brief. Other than that there is some mild themes of sex, as well as brief conversations and dialogue revolving around the topic. Never graphic. Some crude humor A man in a dream looks up a bunch of women's skirts ( nothing shown ) A nude woman runs past a window in a backyard. No detail can be seen. The violence is played for humor, but some instances are intense. A severed toe wrapped in gauze is sent in the mail. There is some blood on the bandage as it is unwrapped. Thugs come into The Dude's home and smash his belongings with a cricket bat. Walter uses a crowbar to destroy a Corvette. The owner of the Corvette later uses the crowbar to destroy The Dude's car. A police officer throws a coffee cup at The Dude's forehead and pushes him to the floor. A thug interrogates The Dude by shoving his head into a toilet. Another thug urinates on The Dude's carpet. A man gets hit in the stomach by a bowling ball; he almost vomits and appears to be in pain. The Dude is shown smoking marijuana a couple of times and he is constantly high. The Dude drinks ""White Russians"" in several scenes. In one scene, The Dude drinks beer and smokes marijuana while driving, causing an accident. Characters smoke cigarettes. The instances of people breaking into the Dude's home an assaulting him may be difficult for some viewers. Overall the film is a comedy and even the tense moments are meant to be took jokingly. The kidnappers send a severed toe in order to induce their victims family to pay up. 274 ""f"" words, 36 ""s"" words, 10 slang terms for male genitals (the ""d,"" ""c,"" and ""p"" words along with ""rod"" and ""Johnson""), 1 slang term for female genitals (""beaver""), 22 ""ass"" words (6 using ""hole""), 7 hells, 2 damns, 1 S.O.B., and 7 uses of ""G-damn,"" 5 of ""Jesus,"" 2 of ""Jesus Christ,"" and 1 use each of ""Oh Jesus,"" ""Lord,"" ""By God,"" ""For Christ's sakes"" and ""God"" as exclamations."

Hotel Rwanda	PG-13	3	9	1	5	1	"A woman is seen laying down on the floor, she's breastfeeding her child, while her right breast is shown.

Murder, genocide, and strong violence are often mentioned and described including that of children, sometimes in detail. Gunfire at various parts of the film with some military violence and armed people shot. There are references of suicide. One particularly disturbing scene where several Hutus can be seen screaming, and murdering Tutsis with machetes. A scene where villagers are running from their homes as armed men shoot at them and burn their homes. There are various scenes where people are offered and drink alcoholic beverages. In the beginning, Interahamwe leader Georges Rutaganda sees one of his workers dropping a crate full of machetes, foreshadowing the genocide. Many intense moments of helpless people being threatened by armed attackers. Many scenes where characters see dead bodies. A man is almost forced to shoot his family and neighbors to death as punishment for lying. The subject matter is deeply disturbing and haunting, especially since it is a true story. Some strong language, at least 1 'f' word and a few uses of the word 'shit', some racial slurs towards the Hutu and Tutsi who are often referred to as ""cockroaches"" and the United Nations general uses the word 'nigger'."

Ford v Ferrari	PG-13	2	6	3	5	4	"A man and a woman are shown kissing... 3 kissing scenes are shown throughout the movie Various sequences containing the crashing of cars. No blood or gore is ever shown but several of the crashes are likely fatal. A man is punched in the face, resulting in a bloody nose. The blood is barely visible. Two men fight in one scene. Includes tackling, punching and wrestling. Nothing graphic, and is done mostly for comedic effect. A man had a car accident and the car bursts into flames.

One man grabs another man by his jacket and pushed him back, but quickly releases him. A husband and wife drink beer on their porch. Characters smoke cigarettes.

Several scenes of yelling that are quite intense. The ending is incredibly sad and shocking. The film contains two uses of the word ""fuck.""

Logan	R	1	26	2	7	2	"A woman flashes her breasts at her limo driver. Overall: Frequent, brutal and extremely graphic sequences of high impact action violence with significant blood and injury detail. People are stabbed and decapitated usually with quick but sometimes brutal results. The violence is fast-paced and thus quite hard to not notice. During the opening scene of the film, a gang member shoots Wolverine in the chest with a shotgun, and we see him on the ground with bloody wounds in his chest. As he tries to protect his car, he's shot in the shoulder. The gang members then beat him up and kick him. Wolverine kills them and slices a man's arm off (no blood). We then see their corpses on the ground covered in blood and wounds. This scene is very intense although not too graphic and not much blood or gore. Wolverine tries pulling out one of his claws, and we hear him groan in pain and his hand starts bleeding while we also see his knuckles covered in pus and blood. A woman's right arm is bloodied from a gunshot wound, she stitches it up. A dead woman is shown in a motel with a bullet in her chest, no blood is shown. In a video an empty hospital bed is covered in blood. A man watches a video of scientists performing surgery on a little kid, not much detail is shown. A girl with metal claws cuts herself repeatedly, blood comes out of her arms, a kid commits suicide by jumping off a building, we don't see him fall to the ground but still disturbing. A mutant uses his powers to light a man on fire, (not graphic or shown in detail). Sad and intense. A man is hit in the back of the head with a metal pipe, he then falls to the ground unconscious, later on he wakes up with his face bleeding after being kicked in the face. Three men attempt to capture a girl inside a warehouse, we hear gunshots and screams in pain, implying they are killed. A little girl is carrying a decapitated head, we see the stump, she rolls it on the ground creating a trail of blood. A little girl using her metal claws to kill armed soldiers with a small amount of blood splattering. A man shoots the girl with a harpoon and we see it go right through her, staining her shirt with blood. She then pulls it out of her with lots of blood coming out. Wolverine kills several soldiers by slashing them across the face and body (this mostly includes a small amount of blood). Laura stabs a soldier in the eyes behind a car window and we see lots of blood on the window. A heavily armored truck with people in it is then crushed by a freight train. A mutant's skin burns up and starts swelling and falling apart from being in the sunlight, we hear sizzling and see his horrifically burned face. Wolverine stabs three men frozen in time in the face and abdomen. Laura stabs a wounded soldier in the chest, a small amount of blood is thrown from his chest. Wolverine lies in a hospital bed with several bloody wounds in his chest and abdomen. An intense action sequence shows Wolverine and Laura kill several armed soldiers by stabbing and slashing them across the face, neck and chest in a forest, but this is all shown super quickly making it hard to see any blood and gore or injury detail. Wolverine is shot twice, with a little bit of blood spraying. He grabs a man from behind and uses his gun to shoot a soldier in the head, with bloody results but extremely quick. Wolverine is left standing with some bullet holes, still alive but covered in lots of blood. Several kids use their powers to kill a mercenary, we hear his neck snap and possibly some blood coming from his neck, but this is easy to miss. A kid uses her powers to impale a man with thousands of wood splinters, causing him to bleed as he groans in pain and is eventually torn apart into pieces, causing him to explode into pieces of gore and meat. This is very brief, but is shown mostly on-screen and is one of the more graphic parts in the movie. As said before, in one scene a girl gets a harpoon speared through her heart but survives, although with blood staining her sweatshirt. Very intense, fast-paced and fatal violence throughout. Though this film is very violent (enough to justify the R rating), a lot of the violence is quick. It should be noted that while this movie is violent, it is more of a fast-paced action movie and isn't a gorefest. The film is filled with intense and fast violence. On-screen body count: 76 but in the movie, the violence is very intense. Several extremely intense and chaotic battle sequences throughout. However, they're all fast-paced and there's not much detail because of that, but can still be a bit brutal. Logan and Laura's retractable metal claws are used to slash and kill their enemies. While most of the action is fast and some of it is implied, there are some images of bloody injuries and violence. A kid uses her powers to freeze a man's arm. We see lots of blood and dead tissue building up into a stump as the arm becomes increasingly gangrenous and necrotic until it turns into solid ice. Afterwards, the girl smashes the arm and it's shattered into pieces as the man screams in agony. Quick but kinda gory. Logan buys tobacco, but we do not see him smoking onscreen. Logan is seen drinking alcohol throughout the film. He is also seen injecting himself with a medical drug towards the end of the movie. Logan give medication to Professor X, as well as inject medicine into him, to end his seizures. The beginning of the film pretty much gives you a good idea of how violent the film is going to be, but as it goes on the violence escalates. The whole film is very bleak and depressing, and has the tone and look of a dystopian movie. There are incredibly intense scenes such as the warehouse fight, and some scenes have somewhat of a horror vibe to them. Wolverine is covered in blood in a lot of scenes. The forest battle is pretty brutal, with Wolverine running and clawing through various mercenaries as he is shown roaring angrily. The character that Boyd Holbrook plays is a mercenary who enjoys inflicting harm upon mutant children. This movie is intense but not that scary at all. However, it's very bleak. Overall the profanity isn't too frequent and the majority of it comes from Logan himself. 54 uses of ""fuck"", several uses of ""shit"" and ""asshole"", 4 uses of ""dick"" and 4 uses of ""damn"","

One involves Chris and Wayne being drunk. There are hippies that are referenced as ""dope smokers"" and are seen smoking for a couple of seconds.

Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl	PG-13	10	13	4	6	3	"A brief moment - an evil captain throws a girl toward his crew to make her his prisoner. He menacingly says that she should show them the same hospitality that he did before. Then the crew members start touching and groping her menacingly - some tug at her clothes. This is stopped soon though William and Elizabeth share a kiss. There are some sexual references. Elizabeth wears a white dress that gets wet. Her nipples and the outline of her breasts can be seen vaguely. Dresses reveal cleavage. During a sword fight with Will, Jack suggests that Will found a love interest and is ""unable to woo said strumpet"" and then asks him if he is a eunuch. ""Strumpet"" is a dated term for a female prostitute and ""eunuch"" refers to a castrated man. Two men tell a girl she will be forced to dine naked with the crew, if she refuses to wear the dress that Barbossa instructed her to wear for dinner. The crew expresses disappointment when she says she'll dine with Barbossa. Elizabeth is told to take her dress off (although she is wearing a tight dress underneath so she is not naked). The man makes a remark about the dress still being ""warm"". Seduction is implied on a desert island scene when Elizabeth pretends to be drunk and seductive in order to get Jack to drink more. Two women slap Captain Jack Sparrow about him with ""another woman."" Near by the beginning when the pirates come to Port royal there is a massive fight include: slashings stabbings and Shootings they're fairly violent and intense Barbossa shoots one of his crew to see if they are still cursed. Action/Adventure violence and very mild blood In an early scene, we see men turn into gruesome, decaying skeletons when hit by the moonlight. Multiple scenes involving pirates sword fighting and gunfire, with some individuals that are stabbed or shot (non-graphic). A man is shot in the chest and blood soaks his shirt then he falls over dead. Dead pirate corpses are seen hung by nooses. (no blood) A tomahawk axe digs into a pirate's back, but no blood is shown when retrieved. A pirate is stabbed (not shown), then we see blood on the retracted knife. The pirate is cursed to be undead and so survives. Pirates raid a village, and in one scene, a butler opens the door to a mansion and is immediately shot by pirates. A pirate with a fake eye gets a fork stuck in his eye. He takes the fork out and you can see his fake eye on the fork. There is a fairly intense battle scene between the living and the undead, but it is done under moonlight and nothing overly graphic is shown. However, it could be considered quite frightening. An undead sailor slits the throat of a soldier. You see it from behind but it is still very violent. Some drinking. Characters are shown drunk. Jack was drinking beer in a scene This is about pirates, so expect use of alcohol. Lots of rum use The scene where Elizabeth first sees Barbossa and his crew as undead skeletons (which are apparently their true form) is rather creepy In an early scene, Jack Sparrow sees some corpses on nooses implied to be from pirates that were executed by hanging and put there as a warning to other pirates. Some Scary Moments There are visuals that show various sights of pirates that turn (completely or partially) into living skeletons (and partially decomposed bodies) when moonlight hits them. Hanged corpses are seen multiple times. There is a very intense scene where pirates raid a village and kill people, and at one point you see a structure collapse on a little boy. The mom saves the boy just in time, though. 1 use of""Shit"" 1 ""shit"",1 ""bastard"", 1 ""damn"", 2 ""damned"", 4 ""Hell"", 1""Scum""' 2 "" 5 ""bloody"" and some (rather dated) name-callings and insults such as ""eunuch"" (used twice), ""strumpet"", ""scum"" and ""cur"". Note: ""bloody"" is considered (mildly) vulgar in the UK."

His passenger is dead, with his face covered in blood. In the first third of the film, there are many instances of dogfighting. The fights themselves are intense and very violent, but mostly take place offscreen. The aftermath is very graphic and unpleasant to look at. Many dead, bloody dogs shown. One dog has a ""snapped neck,"" and other dogs are missing large patches of skin. Blood is all over the floor at the dog-fighting ring. A person is beaten with a rod in the shower.

It is revealed she has been hit by her husband. Celia has a miscarriage, and we see her on the bathroom floor, a brief image of (a lot) of blood between her legs, as she screams. She later buries the child in her front yard, with her other miscarriages. She has never told her husband. Virtually everyone, Skeeter included, smokes. And in a self-conscious wink at people's attitudes toward smoking during that era, Skeeter's boss says, ""I guarantee you one day they're going to figure out that cigarettes kill you."" Social drinking is almost as frequent as the smoking. Many scenes picture (white) people downing mixed drinks or martinis. A would-be-suitor for Skeeter is obviously drunk, and he keeps ordering shots. Celia is likewise inebriated at a socialite event, and is sick (off screen). Hilly drinks and drives in one scene.

The Iron Giant	PG	2	8	3	4	3	"Some innocuous flirtation among a couple of adults. Such as a moment where after Mansley meets Hogarth, he stumbles across his mother Annie only to find himself oogling her for about a split-second by quickly dragging his eyes from her hips all the way to her bust. We see a boy unzip his pants in a bathroom and is seen sitting on the toilet with his pants down, though his underwear is still on. A man unzips his fly and a squirrel jumps out (this is seen from behind). After the Iron Giant gets shot by tanks, bazookas, machine guns, armed aircraft and other types of military artillery, it starts obliterating many tanks and armored vehicles after going into attack mode from thinking they killed Hogarth. A deer is shot and killed by hunters. No blood is or wound is seen, only the body. A man goes through the window of a boat and is knocked onto rocks on the shore. Hogarth sprints into a tree branch and quickly wakes up with a nosebleed from the impact. Mansley grabs a Hogarth by the face and threatens him, and then swiftly knocks him out by putting a handkerchief laced with chloroform to the boy's face. Two boys almost fall off a roof; a boy gets knocked unconscious. The Iron Giant took a bite into a power station and gets electrocuted (the scene is very noisy and scary). A big robot carries a boy in his hand, towering above the trees, and the boy looks scared. We see a brain on TV that moves across the floor by itself. A lot of scatological humor (diarrhea, constipation). A man uses a chemical covered handkerchief to knock out a boy. Some locals attribute a fisherman's story about the giant to ""either whiskey or beer."" A government agent smokes and carries a pipe several times during the film. A boy watches an old horror movie on tv; a giant brain starts eating a man's head, but the scene is cut off. A fisherman's boat is sunk. Hogarth hears something either upstairs or on the roof and slowly goes to find the source of the noise. Later, Hogarth slowly makes his way through a darkened forest (with his flashlight) and follows the destructive path of something obviously quite large. In the ""Signature Edition"" a newly added scene shows the Giant having a dream containing his memories both on Earth and additionally shows a possibility where he originally came from. He remembers the other robots resembling him destroying a city and blowing up an entire planet which awakens him in fear. A couple of anatomical references, several scatological references and mild obscenities; some name-calling. ""Damn it"" is used by the antagonist's boss when he phones him at home; 1 other use of 'damn'. 2 uses of 'hell' as an expletive."

An extended car chase with several crashes and gunshots fired. A character drinks a substance that causes them to see a vision and gives them some superpowers.

A seriously injured soldier takes his own life by repeatedly stabbing himself in the neck, resulting in strong bloody detail.

See How They Run	PG-13	3	7	1	0	1	"A man makes a remark to a woman about having a ""silver tongue"". He makes a lewd gesture to the woman with his tongue. During a man doing a storyboard, he reveals his hand drawn work of a naked woman from her back including buttock nudity. Very mild dialogue references to affairs. One character is a cad with a ""little black book"" full of women's names and he may have fathered a child out of wedlock. Another man worries that his wife will find out he has been flirting with another woman. A man refers to the man he is living with as his ""nephew"" but it's obviously a ruse as homosexual acts between men were illegal in the 1950s. There are several scenes of violence, including a man strangling another using a rope. There are brief bloody images. A man fights with the murderer and is strangled with a rope and then hit on the head with a sewing machine. His body is later found with blood on his shirt and head and coming out of his mouth.

The main character drinks wine to help her cope with post traumatic stress. Very intense and creepy-looking sketches. Plot involves and mentions suicide. Integral plot point. A woman twists her neck (offscreen) and bends her face upside down while smiling outside of a car window. Many solid jump scare scenes. One involving a mutilated face. The film sustains a strong sense of foreboding and threat throughout, with central themes of trauma and death. There are frequent jump scares and some very strong violence. Rose is listening to a recording of Laura on her laptop and keeps rewinding to investigate a low sound, the entity then appears next to her screaming her name, probably the most frighting scene as the jumpscare is quite unexpected MA15+ ( Strong Violence, Horror Themes & Coarse Language ) 50 uses of ""fuck"" 1 use of ""Jesus Christ"""

Amsterdam	R	3	6	4	2	1	"A woman's bare back is naked but no nudity is shown. Side breasts are briefly visible but nothing explicit. Kissing scenes throughout the movie between Harold & Valerie and Burt & Irma. 2 scenes have male topless nudity, in one legs also are shown Infrequent gun and hand-to-hand violence with some blood and wound detail. An autopsy is shown; it is largely non graphic with split second shots of the organs. At one point the two people conducting the autopsy search through the subject's stomach contents. Again, non graphic. Flashbacks of two men having received multiple wounds and injuries are shown, in bloody detail. This is likely what the ""bloody images"" in the rating is referring to. This is the most graphic scene in the film, but still isn't very graphic. A man adjusts the alignment of a woman's broken wrist. This is off screen, but we still hear her groans of pain. A man is punched and smacked several times in the face, being knocked to the ground, causing his glass eye to fly out. Woman shoved in front of car, run over, body smashed underneath car. Frequent portrayals of alcohol, tobacco, and substance use in a recreational context. A man reveals that he was addicted to pain medication through a narration played over shots of him injecting said pain medication in his arm. Later, he is shown passed out in an alley way; whether or not this is from an overdose is never made clear. Although the character makes it clear that this is due to vertigo, a woman accuses said character of being drunk based on her constant stumbling. Two men use an eyedrop that numbs pain, said to be a steroid from Zurich. The aforementioned war flashbacks, and shots of the soldiers in the care units are admittedly pretty gnarly. They don't last long, but can be painful to watch The main character has a glass eye. May be disturbing to ommetaphobic viewers. A single use of ""fuck"", with a couple ""damn""s here and there."

Black Panther	PG-13	5	8	2	0	5	"One brief scene of a man and a woman kissing. Non-sexual shirtless scenes. A man and a woman make out briefly in a van.

When removing it, it looks as if he could be exposing himself. Very brief, played for comedy. Some Wakandan women wear revealing outfits, but this is not portrayed in a sexual manner. There are battles with swords, spears, guns and fantastical weapons. The violence in Black Panther is slightly more intense and realistic than other MCU films. Characters are impaled and slashed with spears and swords, the blood and wounds not always focused on by the camera. A man is stabbed in the chest, another the same, another stabbed in the abdomen. A man is cut numerous times during a fight A large battle/civil war takes place with friends fighting each other.

You see the woman's bloody, severed head for a few seconds. There are some scenes of strong bloody violence throughout the film, but it focuses more on the shock value and gore than the actual violence. All of the violence in the movie is made to look similar to technicolor style 30's film. Bright red blood with detail. A man and woman smoke in an alley for a brief scene.

Thor and Jane kiss in a couple of scenes throughout the movie Extended sequences of fantasy violence where characters are stabbed and briefly decapitated with golden blood detail that splatters all over the place and onto people. Injury detail is largely limited to small bloody cuts and sprays of golden or purple blood from fantasy creatures and characters. A god is stabbed in the throat quite suddenly and golden blood spills down his neck. Then he is either decapitated or hewn in half off screen. And alien creature's head gets ripped right off in front of the children with its purple blood dripping down to scare them. somewhat shocking and gross (though the creature is rather ugly and worm like) A woman is bloodied from battle and loses her arm (not really shown until later) Shadow monsters attack a village and kill and throw people around. they take all types of scary forms. The goriest moment is when Thor first tries to summon Mjölnir and as it gets closer to him, it rips through a giant monster.

The Batman	PG-13	8	10	6	4	10	"We watch through binoculars as Selina Kyle removes her shirt and pants. She is wearing a white bra and panties before putting on her biking clothes. A man and a woman kiss 2 times. No sex scenes. The first one is rather passionate and the second one is brief. A few rather quick kisses. A photo is shown of the mayor in a compromising pose with a suggestively dressed woman who is not his wife, implying infidelity. Penguin makes a crude joke about this. A naked (blurred) woman can be seen dancing in the bar. A girl entres the penguin's club. The camera shows suggestively dressed women dancing. Bruce Wayne is seen shirtless a few times. After Bruce Wayne leaves the club, a poster of a suggestive woman can be seen on a wall near the train tracks in the background. Easy to miss. Several action sequences that include shootings, fistfights, electrocutions, and sequences in which people are repeatedly punched or bludgeoned. However most of this is off-screen or no blood is shown Mutilated bodies are found at crime scenes, and there is repeated views of a severed thumb. A man is hit with a metal tool while sitting in his car. A mans get hits hard to the face with a bat. Batman shoots a grapple hook through an attacker's leg and then hangs him from it. No blood and this scene is darkly lit, which makes it hard to see clearly Intense action sequences throughout. The first action scene takes place in a subway station. A gang of clowns want to assault a man but Batman comes in and takes all of them down with punches. He also electrocutes one man and slams him onto a wall before dropping him with rage Batman is seen flying around the city. When he lands, he ends up hitting a truck and violently falling. The tone however, is slightly comedic rather than shocking. A man is shot in the back of the neck by a sniper's bullet. Though the actual act is obscured and brief, a few drops of blood are shown on the man's face and glasses as he dies. Batman kicks off the attackers, who are attached to zip-lines, and are shown as if they were hanging. Part of the plot revolves around a fictitious drug business; the drug consists of drops placed in people's eyes. Addicts are called ""dropheads"". Much of the movie revolves around a drug ring. Several scenes where characters drink. A man under the influence of alcohol or drugs is overly talkative. Towards the climax Batman injects what seems to be adrenaline to keep fighting Multiple scenes take place in a club/bar Scenes include people in states of terror and distress after being placed in elaborate death traps. The tone is frequently dark and menacing, and includes scenes of gun threat and acts of terrorism. The Riddler is a very frightening killer. His costume resembles The Zodiac Killer's. His presence is very menacing. He tends to act slightly psychotic as well, rapidly accelerating his pace of words and/or snapping at seemingly nothing, which can be unsettling at times. The whole film is extremely intense. Batman is intense in this movie. 'Godd*mn' is said six times. 'D*ckbag' is said once. 'F*ck' is said once. 'Prick' is said once as an insult. 'B*stard' is said. 'Son of a b*tch' is said five times. 'Sh*t' is said seven times. 'H*ll' is said seven times. '*ss' is said twice and '*sshole' is said once. 'Gimp' is said once as an insult."

Avatar	PG-13	4	8	6	3	15	"A few very mild sex references. The Na'vi people are aliens, but they are humanoid creatures. They dress in a tribal way, and we see their backsides (not fully covered by their tails) quite a bit. The men wear only loincloths, and the women wear loincloths and ornamental, stringy necklaces as bras. A brief suggestive between Jake and Neytiri shows the two kissing and beginning to passionately caress each other. There is no nudity, but they wake together the next morning, and Neytiri explains they are ""mated for life."" In the extended edition, this scene includes the two touching their queues together, implying they can ""feel"" each other (as explained earlier in the film). A few sexual jokes and lines are tossed about, including a masturbation quip from Dr. Augustine (""don't play with that, you'll go blind"" when she sees Jake playing with his queue). The battle at the end is extremely violent and many creatures and humans die. Some deaths are presented in extremely gruesome and extensive detail. The final battle shows people and aliens blown up, stabbed, shot by guns, shot by arrows, and run over. On scene, and in gruesome details. An unfortunate humans' head and shoulders end up in a banshees mouth. Explosions consume man, alien and beast alike. On fire, a horse-like creature runs for its life. Neytiri kills a human with two well-placed shots. Aerial clashes involve banshees vs. the humans aircraft. And while the Navi get mowed down by missiles and gunfire, many of their arrows somehow penetrate cockpits, taking out pilots and gunners, by shots to the face and chest, shown onscreen. Neytiri takes out a viperwolf with an arrow. It contains innocuous alcohol consumption and a reference to smoking. A woman has a drink that's presumably alcoholic. Beer and tequila are mentioned a couple of times. A woman smokes several times, and at one point asks for a cigarette with urgency. (Extended Edition): an early scene take place in a bar on Earth, with Jake apparently participating in a drinking contest. Jake pulls a cigarette out of Grace's mouth and tells her not to smoke. The final battle in the film between the humans and Na'vi is intense and emotional, considering that we see scores of soldiers (on both sides) get stabbed, shot, impaled and crushed by gunfire, arrow piercings and falling objects. Jake has several close encounters with native creatures, which may be intense and in several scenes, they chase him in an attempt to kill and eat him. Several positive characters are killed or mortally wounded on-screen during the movie, which may be disturbing for the audience. The home media releases of the film include a more family-friendly version of the movie that substitutes the swearing for cleaner alternatives. 'Sh*t' is said at least 11 times. 'Godd*mn' is said at least eight times. 'H*ll' is said six times. '*ss' is said four times. 'D-*mn' is said four times. 'Crap' is said three times. 'B*tch' is said three times. 'D*ck' is said twice.

Elvis	PG-13	6	2	5	5	4	"A woman enters Elvis's hotel room and there is a sensual scene of him disrobing her down to her underwear and them making out. Sex is clearly implied. An adolescent Elvis and his friends watch a man and woman performing a sensual dance. Priscilla walks around the bedroom in a short nightie. Her panties and partial buttocks are briefly shown. Teen girls and adult women throw their panties on the stage and at Elvis in multiple scenes. He usually picks them up and at one point he puts them on his head.

Elvis himself receives several death threats during performances. Colonel Parker is almost always seen smoking a cigar. Many supporting characters smoke cigarettes frequently. Vernon is nearly always shown smoking a cigarette. Elvis smokes cigarillos twice near the end of the movie. Gladys is shown to have a problem with alcohol, which it says contributed to her death. Elvis' drug use is focused on in a few scenes, beginning with when a band member gives him a pill. Others include Dr. Nick giving him an injection. One shot of someone smoking a pipe at a carnival. There is never anything too disturbing or frightening, but there are many emotional and sad scenes. During one of Elvis' performances a riot begins and a police officer beats a man in the rear distance. The film is shot and edited in a rapid pace with constant sound and quick cuts from frame to frame. This is constant throughout the entire film and it rarely slows down, this may overwhelm viewers. Elvis rages at Las Vegas might shock viewers over Colonel's Firing The ending is very depressing There is one brief use of the f-word during a rage at a concert. Other uses are: ""damn"", ""hell"", ""sh*t"", ""son of a bitch"", ""piss"", and ""whore"". One use of ""bastard"" Slurs matching the time period of the film are used 5 times. Goddamnit/Goddamn is used 14 times 14 uses of goddamn 3 uses of shit 1 with bull 1 with horse 2 uses of son of a bitch and bastard 1 use of fuck"

Blonde	NC-17	13	2	2	7	1	"Marilyn's nude calendar and other nude photos are seen at various times. Marilyn is topless in many home life scenes. Frequent partial frontal female (breast) nudity. Three ""vagina"" moments, including during an abortion, show no genitals, but rather are POV looking outward. In addition to bare breasts, brief buttocks seen from Marilyn, partially darkened and brief female full frontal from a different character, and an oral sex scene (female on male, closeup of her face and hand obscure genitalia). Not overtly graphic in nudity, but mature themes present throughout. When a young Norma Jean is being nearly drowned by her mother, her mom is shown displaying topless and some vague frontal nudity. Young Norma Jean also seems to be nude but no nudity shown. Although this scene may come across unsettling for some, it is befitting the plot, describing the fact that Norma Jean was abused by both men and women in her life. Marilyn has a flashback to getting raped during an audition, after Joe DiMaggio asks her how she got her start. No nudity is shown. Norma Jeane's mother's bare breasts are shown during a bathtub scene. A vague frontal nude shot is then seen after Norma Jeane has been taken in by a neighbour.

A man beat his own partner. A woman becomes reliant on pills and overuses them at times and even contemplates on committing suicide with them. Various characters drink and smoke cigarettes. Gladys smokes a cigarette. Marilyn smokes occasionally. The story of Marylin Monroe is very depressing and the movie often shows how tragic her career in Hollywood is. A mother is mentally ill. She attempts to drown her daughter while giving her a bath. There are two rape scenes in this movie and both of them are very uncomfortable to watch. A woman has several outbursts where she lets out demonic like screams. There is a scene in a mental hospital and we see several patients in straight jackets screaming manically. A dark room sequence at the end, shows a shadowy figure (a man) standing against the wall while Marilyn feels her way around her bedroom and halls.

Knives Out	PG-13	6	2	6	6	8	"No sex, nudity or cleavage shown throughout. A character says a caretaker ""boinked"" her father, and other characters repeat the implication that the two characters (several decades apart in age) had sex. This is known to the audience to be unsubstantiated. Direct repeated reference to masturbation by a teenage boy, twice in obscene spoken context; it is not shown or otherwise visually implied. Photographs of a man with a woman other than his wife, implying a sexual affair. A boy says you had sex with my grandfather.

They are then stabbed in the neck with a needle, overdosing them with morphine. A spider crawls across a dimly-lit face There are 5 vomit scenes. Usually it is done into an inanimate object (there is one exception). A mild jump scare where a woman is found pale and unconscious with a spider crawling across her face A man says that America is for Americans and talks badly about Immigrants, this can upset some viewers. (Deleted. Personal opinions about ratings are not appropriate for the Parents Guide.) The 'f' word is said three times, 's' word is said 25 times throughout, and ""bitch"" is said on a few occasions. Damn is said around 6 times. 4+ uses of goddamn 7 uses of g*dd*mn (3 of which are repeated from the same scene being replayed and one is inaudible amongst characters yelling but can be seen clearly in the subtitles). The 's' word is said 25 times throughout. asshole is said several times The word, ""Anchor Baby"" is only used once toward a Latin American woman. Around five times the use of Jesus' name"

Morbius	PG-13	3	4	0	2	1	"Two kissing scenes. In the sequence where Milo is dancing, the song playing in the background ""EKSE"" by Off The Meds contains the phrase ""have sex"" in it's chorus and it can be heard four times during the dance sequence. Topless male nudity. No female nudity. Supernaturally fast vampires snatch people into the air, throw them into walls, bite them or slash at them with their claws inside throats with some brief cannabalism, occasionally resulting in dark blood spurts and bloody aftermath detail that are highly stylised with visually colourful effects. One man grabs another's hand and squeezes it, creating loud 'crunch' sounds as the bones break Disabled people are beaten up several times in a sadistic way. Characters who are vampires need to drink blood to keep them alive. Characters are seen drinking a lot of blue blood bags throughout the film  There are scenes of strong horror and threat, with occasional 'jump scare' moments, when people are chased and attacked by vampires. People with vampirism are seen with distorted faces, fangs and claws There is a scene where Michael Morbius says, ""It's Morbin' Time!"" and morbs everywhere. A very brief use of ""fuck"" during an interrogation and other infrequent mild uses of ""shit"", and ""ass"""

Midsommar	R	7	6	5	6	1	"At two points in the film, menstrual blood is implied to have been consumed. It has been snuck into a regular meal and drink. Swedish paintings are shown several times throughout the film, sometimes with nudity. Full frontal female nudity from fifteen women AND one Male full frontal nudity (prolonguen) Prolonged scene (though intercut with another) of a group of nude women chanting/ singing. A brief sex scene between two characters. A few sexual jokes are made, mostly by one character. There are a few references to incest It is implied that a character drowned offscreen. A man wears another man's face as a mask. This is shown for a split second in a darkly lit shot. A (heavily implied dead) man is shown hanging upside down from the ceiling with ropes tied on his legs and arms, unconscious. His lungs have been pulled through his back outside his body, similar to a Blood Eagle execution done by the Vikings in ancient times. A man gets hit over the back of the head with a hammer and falls to the ground. A little blood is shown underneath his head when he see him on the floor. An amputated leg is shown sticking out from the soil in a garden. In one scene, two elderly people willingly sacrifice themselves by jumping off a cliff in front of a crowd standing by. We a see the graphic impact of the woman's face hitting the ground and getting completely torn apart and then another graphic closeup of her extremely disfigured and torn apart face. The man then jumps off the cliff and doesn't die but it completely destroys one of his legs in an extremely gory way, which is graphically shown in closeup. Another cult member walks to him with a large wooden hammer, and graphically smashes his head apart. This is shot very closeup. Through out the movie many people consume hallucinogens, both knowingly and unknowingly. The ground distorts behind them though it is hard to notice. A woman takes Ativan during an anxiety attack. Throughout the series of rituals, people drink shots of what is presumably hard liquor; it is unclear whether it is laced with a hallucinogen or not. A man has a powder, presumably a sedative and paralytic, blown into his face. A man is constantly seen vaping. The intense, constant brightness and colorfulness of the film matched with some of the onscreen violence is an unusual combination, which may turn some viewers off from watching it. The film deals with an array of themes such as unhappy relationships, trauma, mental illness, etc. Strong ritualistic violence and grisly images. The many deaths throughout may be difficult for many viewers. R18+ ( Graphic injury Detail & Strong Adult Themes ) this is definitely Adults ONLY movie The main character has a hallucination in a mirror of a woman with a gas mask. The sunny atmosphere in contrast with the frightening situations makes the whole movie even more disturbing. The chilling score elevates the scares. 35 uses of ""fuck"". Several uses of ""shit"" and ""ass"" as well."

American Psycho	R	8	18	3	5	1	"There is naked women seen very briefly on a TV in the background. A man is seen in a tanning bed, his bare chest being visible briefly. Nothing else is shown. Patrick's butt is briefly seen when he showers. A notebook contains drawings of nude women. Buttocks are shown. One brief sex scene - one is under the covers so no nudity. It also can be pretty easy to find the times of when this scene starts and when it finishes. A man attempts to strangle another man in the bathroom. The victim mistakes the perpetrators voilence as a sexual advance, the perpetrator is upset/disturbed by this and leaves the bathroom. In the sex scene, a man and a woman have sex. Nudity is briefly seen, this lasts around a minute, but you can barely see it. A pretty short sex scene (around a minute) takes place in this movie. It's pretty comedic while showing some nudity though you mainly just see Patrick staring at his own reflection flexing in the mirror. This scene lasts a bit longer in the unrated version. We see a bunch of drawings including pictures of murders of women in a sketch book. Nothing too explicit. There is a decapitated head seen in a fridge. This is not graphic and darkly comedic. A homeless man gets stabbed in the stomach by an other man. Not graphic at all. Violent, but very little is on screen. You really only see aftermaths of violence. Acts of violence are usually obscured or offscreen. Mainly implied and not graphic. A man kills an escort. Some blood and the violence is offscreen. Some graphic violence is depicted in the film. But it's nowhere near as graphic, lengthy and detailed as the original book. A man is killed with an axe. He is kept off-camera as he is being struck. Very mild compared to most other horror films. A chainsaw is dropped on someone from a great height. The impact is offscreen and no sounds are heard. A few bodies of people are briefly shown in a closet, and a bloody corpse is partially seen in a bathroom for a second. One woman is briefly seen with a slightly bloodied face after an implied act of violence. A man is bloodlessly stabbed a few times around the upperbody. An animal is swiftly stepped on and killed but this is partially obscured by a trash pile. Not graphic. An old woman is shot in the chest and drops dead. A kitten is threatened with a gun. A policeman is briefly shot in the chest and a squad car blows up. A woman opens a book and is shocked to find preschool-level drawings of people being murdered. A watchman and a cleaner are killed quickly by a gunshot. No blood seen. A man is shot in the head and slumps back in his chair with blood spraying on the wall behind him. This is extremely brief A man takes drugs with some of his friends. This is in the background and very brief. A lot of alcohol is consumed, and some people are shown under the influence of drugs. Not graphic Some characters smoke and drink. Patrick tries to kill many people. While viewers may find this disturbing, the film has a darkly comedic tone at the same time. While the movie is sometimes (rarely) graphic, it's definitely not as graphic as the novel. The film leaves out graphic scenes from the book like the rat scene and many others. This movie has a very comedic tone to it. Not as graphic as your normal horror movie. This movie is a comedy/psychological thriller. Sometimes the situation that characters are in would be found in somewhere like a horror movie. But the movie maintains the comedic aspect. R18+ ( Strong Violence & Sex Scenes ) 19 uses of ""Fuck""."

Hellraiser	R	3	5	2	0	1	"Two sex scenes with kissing, moaning and thrusting, but no nudity is shown. The first sex scene is a series of quick cuts of two people having sex. The second scene is a bird's eye view of the same people having sex in a different scene, but a blanket covers their bodies. It last for maybe 3-4 seconds, and is in slow motion. Male buttocks briefly shown. Close up of male genitalia for a brief second towards the very end of the film. A girl is being tortured by Cenobites and chains hook into her flesh and contort her body into painful positions. Her entire back is later ripped away from the rest of her body. The Cenobites mutilations are shown in great detail. Tendons, bones, flayed skin, metal wires and other objects are inserted. A man is attacked by hooked chains that are summoned after solving the puzzle box. The first pierces his leg in bloody detail before being dragged across the floor. He is then seen being held up in the air by several other chains pierced through his limbs and torso; no gory detail as this is shot from far away. The man screams in agony throughout and the sound of new hooks stabbing him can be heard, which is unsettling to hear. His death is not shown onscreen. Numerous characters are accidentally/deliberately stabbed with blades that protrude from the puzzle box. Blood and small open wounds from the trauma is often shown. Wires are summoned by a cenobite, wrapping around the face, throat and arms of a male victim, pinning him face-up against a platform. Blood spatters as the wires tighten. The skin off one of the victims forearms is degloved by the wires (graphic!) Cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption in a few scenes. The main character struggles with substance abuse, and is seen taking pills.  77 uses of ""fuck"", including a few barely audible ones, and frequent uses of ""shit""."

The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent	R	7	4	3	1	15	"Several sexual references, with some more graphic than others. ""Fuck"" is used sexually multiple times. Talk about a character thinks Humphrey Bogart was a porn star. Nick Cage kisses an imaginary version of himself, when he gets drunk - the scene is very awkward and played for laughs. At a teenage birthday party there is a teenage girl with cleavage. Two adult female characters with cleavage. Cage makes a gesture for oral sex. A few men are bare chested at a pool. Comedic mild non-graphic stabbings. Gunfire with brief blood splatter. Several punches are thrown. An extended sequence of a car chases. Two men take LSD and are shown high for an extended period.

The Lost City	PG-13	5	2	3	3	9	"A nude man's buttocks are seen in close up for an extended period as a woman pulls leeches off his skin. He then faces her, and she reacts to his offscreen penis, which she implies to be big. Sandra Bullock's outfit shows a lot of cleavage and she is wearing it for the majority of the movie A couple of ending kisses as reward for saving the damsel in distress. Da'Vine Joy Randolph's character shows a lot of cleavage from the outfits she wears Multiple innuendo throughout. Mostly lighthearted action violence, with punches, kicks, and knocking people out with hard objects, and one man falls to his death, and two bikers falling off a cliff. A man is sniped in the head, mostly offscreen, but with intense blood splatter that is seen on the clothes of two people who were next to him for a while. A character offers drinks to others. A character drinks chardonnay in the bathtub. A side character is usually smoking a cigar and at one point blows smoke in Sandra's face. A passing reference to ""coke"". Any frightening and intense scenes are played for laughs and much more funny than scary. The shooting of a character is intense. The main characters are being pursued and are in hiding for a large portion of the film. The Lord's name is taken in vain many times, including 'Oh God' said 11 times, 'Oh my God' said nine times, and 'Jesus', 'Mother of 'God', and 'My God' said at least once. 'Sh*t' is said three times.

The Black Phone	R	3	6	2	14	5	"A person jokingly talks about sex briefly. An older man is briefly seen shirtless twice. It is heavily suggested throughout the film that the child abductor and murderer is also a pedophile. Bizarre sequence of a game called ""naughty boy"" with pedophilic sexual undertones. In one scene, he tells a young boy that he will not ""do anything to him that he will not like,"" implying child molestation. A kid punched another kid A kid is punched in the face during a fight and blood is seen on his face A little girl was hit by a bully A kid is hit in the head by a rock, some blood is seen on his head. But it's not too graphic. A boy stabs a man in the arm, blood is briefly shown. In one of the opening scenes, one of the protagonists is shown fighting a bully. The protagonists beats up the bully. He is later seen washing blood off of his hands. A man snorts something once or twice, but nothing is really shown, except for his head and the snorting sound. A man is addicted to alcohol and can be seen drinking multiple times. Frequent scenes that hold a strong sense of threat where a man kidnaps children, then is kind to them before he kills them. A father repeatedly hits his daughter with a belt, resulting in her loudly crying. May be triggering for abuse survivors. Images where the ghosts of child murder victims are seen with bruises, injury and severed throats. Brief verbal references to suicide involving children. There are a few jump scares in the movie featuring ghosts Dead children with blood and injuries can be seen in a few scenes. There are jump scares and graphic images involving dead victims. A kid was attacked by a serial killer with balloon and drugged. A girl sees ghosts while riding a bike on the street. The kidnap scene is very intense and eerily realistic. Quite a few startling jumpscares. Spanking of a young girl, no nudity but the scene is disturbing. The film as a whole is intense, and it has an unsettling and creepy atmosphere. A child is kidnapped and put into a van. The most disturbing thing about this is how realistic it is. Movie is about kidnappings. One use each of ""cunt"" and ""cock"", around 29 uses of ""fuck"", one use of ""fag"" and several uses of ""shit"". Finney's sister Gwen uses strong profanity throughout the movie. One of the dead boys is very explicit and uses ""fuck"", ""motherfucker"" or other swear words multiple times in many sentences. He also calls a boy a ""cuntwad"" at one point. One use of the racial slur ""beaner"". 3 bullies call Finney a ""fag."""

Oblivion	PG-13	6	8	1	2	1	"A man and woman wake up in bed together. No nudity. During the narrative somewhat in the beginning, a woman takes a shower as the camera shoots from behind. Her hip and a little bit of the right breast are slightly visible as she gestures towards a man (presumably naked) coming into the scene. A man is seen in the shower. No nudity. A woman removes her dress from behind, her back and her rear are shown as she is fully nude. However this scene is dark and only somewhat visible. The woman is then shown as she swims across the pool. When the man joins her, they kiss passionately as they go below the water surface.

At the end of these scenes, they wake up in bed and both are dressed. Only female nudity is shown throughout these scenes; there is no male nudity. A woman is shown wearing a long shirt only with bare thighs and legs visible. But this is neither sex nor nudity. There is a scene of implied sex, but no nudity. Two people in a shuttlecraft fly through a lightning storm as they are pursued by drones firing laser machine guns at them and bumping into them trying to destroy their vessel, unsuccessfully. There is a fistfight between two men with a lot of rifle pointing; a gun fires offscreen, later we learn another human was hit by it (we see blood on her hand). The woman has a large patch of blood on her stomach from the gunwound. A first aid tool is used to heal it, with the warning it'll hurt a lot then the camera cuts away and we hear very distraught screaming. A man confronts several aliens, firing his laser-rifle, a drone appears behind him and fires laser-guns to try to destroy the aliens - it unclear if any die or not. A drone fires on a woman, evaporating her into bits of ash and floating cloth which land on a man. Another woman fires a weapon at the drone and destroys it.

Watcher	R	5	7	3	3	2	During The Opening A Couple Make Out Strip Club Scene Shows Topless Women At the beginning a couple removes clothing and starts to have sex.

In each of these drinking is casual. At the marketing reception a woman becomes slightly tipsy drinking champagne, later becomes upset and causes a waiter to drop his tray. This Movie Is About A Women Being Stalked By A Serial Killer It Can Be Very Intense A woman believed she is being stalked by a serial killer.

A very old bottle with presumed alcoholic beverage is found and one of the characters takes a drink from the bottle. Lots of fighting and punching Occasional moderate uses 'shit' and it's variations are used regularly, there is also use of 'son of a bitch' 'bastard' 'piss' and some religious profanities. moderate uses of ""shit"" and ""ass"" with no F bombs. One use of ""Bitch,"" ""I don't have time for this Damn mission,"" ""Hell,"" & ""dammit"""

Lyle, Lyle, Crocodile	PG	2	0	1	1	0	2 parents kiss a few times Dad refers to an affair when Mom appears and is acting 'Happier'  Adult Characters are seen drinking alcohol multiple times throughout the film including Lyle. Overall, Lyle is very sweet and timid though some of his roars can be a little intense and sudden for little viewers. When members of the Primm family meet Lyle, they are taken off guard and very frightened. This is portrayed in a comedic way, though may be a little unsettling for children to see the mom and dad so frightened. 

Dune	PG-13	3	9	4	8	5	"Very mild exposure in one scene of the side of buttocks as a naked man sits in a sauna and in another with a drugged man naked at a table. A few scenes where people kiss. The Baron's female servants wear transparent gowns. However, nothing clear can be seen. Characters are shot and stabbed with swords, blades and sci-fi weapons with moderate visual representation of post-action blood detail. A character poisons a room full of people. Deaths occur offscreen but audible, and the aftermath is shown (sunken in faces) The characters fight almost exclusively using close combat knives and swords, so there are several fight scenes including stabbing and cutting throats (never shown up close but in wide angle) Many people are hung upside down and drained of blood so that the Sardaukhar Army may receive blood marks on their forehead as a ceremony into their army. A character is impaled by a dart which in turn paralyzes him. A bit of blood and a injury detail is seen including a bloody hand and knife A character is slapped and later gut punched brutally when tied up. Scenes include close-quarters combat with bladed weapons, including slashes and stabbings resulting in brief sight of blood. There is occasional focus on bloodied blades, or blood on hands and clothes. Other sequences depict large scale attacks in which ships and buildings are bombed and explode, and a number of deaths caused by toxic gas A character grabs another man by the hair and hoists him up as he brings up a blade to his neck and slices. The camera cuts away but you hear the squelch of the blade decapitating the man. Next shot shows the character briefly holding the severed head before dropping it, but no gore is shown as it is blocked by a table in the foreground. There is a fictional hallucinogenic drug named ""spice"" that plays a pivotal role in the films plot, but it is not shown being abused. Mild alcohol use. The fremen have blue eyes due to spice addiction. Paul breathes in the spice melange in one scene. A man is implied to be drugged. There are several intense battle scenes Two characters fight to the death in a knife duel Two characters fight for their survival by using their powers to make their captors kill each other. We see a mostly silhouetted creature that looks like it's composed of various human parts, and crawls around on several human arms. We don't see it very well but it is disturbing. Characters are swallowed by a massive frightening sandworm. Scenes of threat include characters being pursued and attempting to escape giant worms, flying through a sandstorm, fleeing from explosions, being held at knife point, and being targeted by remote devices that inject poison. A character is left paralysed by poison, and his body is seen naked in a chair as his enemies mock him ""The Voice"" that is used by the Bene Gesserit is intense and frightening. The sandworms are quite frightening, appearing as extremely gruesome and gigantic leech-like creatures that borrow beneath the dunes of Arrakis, have lamprey-like mouths with thousands of baleen-like structures, resembling human eyes seen up-close. 3 uses of damn, 1 use of hell, 1 use of ass, 1 use of shit 'D*mn' is said three times. 'H*ll' is said once. '*ss' is said once. 'Sh*t' is said once."

Dinosaurs chomp people up and shake them around making them go all floppy. There are cuts on people faces.

(As seen in the trailer) About 10 seconds long. A Character Drinks a Beer. Easy to Miss Alan and Ellie drink beer Some tense set-pieces with monsters pursuing, attacking and eating people. Some scenes are shot in a way that make the film look borderline horror. Tense, action chase scenes might scare some Some scenes have a scary build up leading to a jumpscare People cry when scared The Atrociraptors design could be scary to young children. Blue acts aggressive to Owen near the start An Allosaurus is seen attacking a caravan. A woman is screaming at the police A Jaguar is chasing a Compy Quetzacoatlus is seen flying over a city. Not scary but tense Mild uses of 'shit', 'bastard, 'cock', 'damn' and 'hell'. One use of two middle fingers

Aftersun	R	5	0	1	0	1	Absolutely no sexual content apart from some sexual references and some brief scenes of couples kissing/making out. A man is seen lying in bed naked. His butt is shown. It is the only scene with nudity. The film is set in a holiday resort, so there are a lot of people in just underwear or swimsuits. There is one scene in which teenagers talk about how one person gave another person a blowjob. Passionate kissing.  People are seen drinking and the main character smokes a bit throughout the film.  Rated 14A for Coarse language

Disaster Movie	PG-13	2	31	9	2	5	"A man takes off his underwear and throws it at another man. A young man appears nude and we see a full frontal pose (his genital area is covered), jumps onto the back of another young man and we then see the nude man from the back and side (bare buttocks are visible); while struggling, the nude man asks the other man out on a date several times and receives no answer. During a shaky, windy scene, a dozen dismembered arms, thighs, hands, and feet drop from the sky and we see each one, very red, with a bone sticking out (they look like plastic). Four young adults enter a storeroom in the darkness and hear flapping wings, mechanical chipmunks with wide, yellow-ring irises use demonic voices to sing unintelligible lyrics. One foams at the mouth and they all fly and chase the four people, biting them (no blood) on the shoulders, necks, backs. And on the genitals of one male (through clothing); the people beat the chipmunks with metal poles and then trap them in a metal garbage can (we hear grunting, screaming, crying, crunching and thudding), the chipmunks knock down a pregnant teen and eat her back (we see ribs and vertebrae and a small amount of blood and gore.) A young woman eats a beer bottle (we see her very bloody mouth and blood runs down the left side of her chin), and the scene cuts to her on a street outside with friends (no blood). A young woman rides in a car, steps out into broken glass and her bare toes are shown completely bloodied (when she walks into a nearby building, her toes show no blood or injury at all). A large meteor strikes a sidewalk, the camera pans around it and we see the top half of a young woman (she shows no pain and sings commercials). A man falls from the sky to impale himself on a sword held by another man: there is no blood, and the scene ends abruptly. A boulder falls onto a young woman: she disappears, we see no injury and a man screams, ""They killed her, they killed her."" A young woman runs up to a race car, pulls the driver from the car, throws him to the ground, takes an automatic handgun from his pocket, empties two clips of ammo shooting at him (off camera) and she and two friends take the car and drive away. In four scenes we see young adults (two women and two men) shot between the eyes, with the bullet going in and leaving a red circle. In a museum, a young woman is pinned to the floor by the spear of a statue that has fallen forward, we see a streak of blood from her shoulder, three other young people enter the room, one man drops a vase on her head to knock her out but fails, another man punches her in the face and head- butts her twice, she is punched in the face again several times, and the statue is pulled off her and she gets up (her shoulder shows no wound). A young man throws a spear in a museum and jumps onto the back of another young man and they struggle, falling into glass cases and shattering them; no injuries occur. A pregnant teen is shown from the chest-up while, seemingly, her legs come up and kick a man in the face several times without effort; a slimy baby's leg comes up and kicks the man's face as well, it is pushed into the man's mouth and the teen says, ""Suck it!"" The opening sequence is obscured by a very wide black band that runs completely across the middle of the screen, we hear animal growls and see running bare feet and then a bare shoulder in a jungle; when the band disappears it reveals a young bare-chested man lying back on the ground in a close up, another young man in a wrestling singlet stands over him and challenges him to an American Gladiators duel with padded batons, and they struggle and strike each other (there are no visible injuries). A martial arts fight occurs between a giant panda dressed in shorts and a young man: they scuffle, grimace, and screech, use bamboo poles (neither is injured), then break the poles in half and use them to fight again (no one is injured) and the panda is knocked down and the scene ends. A man throws a cable, it sticks to a car, he is dragged down the street and around the corner and reappears unharmed, but dirty, in another scene. A dwarf slams through a stone wall and is unharmed. A young man accidentally hits a young woman in the face with the tip of a whip and we see a red mark. A young man swings on a whip from a ceiling light and an Earth tremor ends the scene. A large paper-maché cow falls onto two men and onto a trio of large mechanical chipmunks; we do not see any injuries and all the characters reappear in other scenes. Two young men in separate scenes are struck in the crotch and bend over in pain, but recover quickly. Throughout the film, young adults slap one another in the face. An earthquake shakes a party hall, everyone runs outside screaming and crying, but no one is hurt; additional tremors occur throughout the film, but no one is injured. Emergency radio broadcasts warn of danger three times and a crowd at a party screams and runs outside each time. We see a large dinosaur skeleton in a dark museum, we see footprints from the skeleton, and men and women scream. A homeless man in dirty clothing sleeps on a bus stop bench and an 8-year-old boy yells insults at him, goes away and the man falls off the bench to end the scene. Throughout the film, a pregnant teen lifts her shirt to show her abdomen, break dances with spinning on her bare abdomen on the ground, sprays milk from both breasts while still clothed (we see this from behind) into the face of a man until he is drenched from head to chest, and ejects the slimy foot of the fetus (we see only the foot, not her genitals) to kick a man in the face and states that her water is breaking. A young woman impersonating Amy Winehouse comes out from behind a tree in a field and has hair two feet high, saber tooth fangs, black and rotten teeth, and tattoos on her right arm, left shoulder, abdomen, and left top of breast. After chugging a gallon of scotch, a young woman burps for a full minute into the face of a young man and then burps several times more. A young man sits on a couch filled with food of all types and stuffs his mouth messily. A pregnant teen pours a pint of vodka into a gallon of orange juice and chugs it at a party, saying it is time to get the baby drunk. A young woman takes a gallon of scotch out of her big hairdo and chugs it (she does not seem affected by it), Two party scenes show hundreds of bottles of beer and wine. Young men and women are shown holding cups and bottles of beer, half-filled glasses of wine, tall glasses of liquor and a few take sips. A man asleep on a bus stop bench rolls off and a bottle of whiskey rolls away on the sidewalk. Bottles of wine are shown on a coffee table in a living room. Two young men fill tote bags with liquor bottles to take away from a party, but drop them when the building begins to shake and the scene ends. Song lyrics contain the phrase ""hooked on reefer."" A young woman holds a cigar in her mouth briefly in a quick camera pan over her face -- the cigar is unlit. None. This is meant to be a comedy The only thing frightening about this movie is the fact that it was made in the first place. 20 uses of shit 2 used as shitty 2 with bull 8 uses of hell 1 use of whore, tits, dick, Jesus christ, hoe, slut, bastard, piss, oh god, screw and bloody 5 uses of bitch 8 uses of ass 2 with hole 3 uses of damn 1 with god People sing the total drama song while saying the s word many times Name-calling. Words include: douche, hoe, stink-eye, battlecross galactica, sea monkey, crackhead, witch, LL Not Cool J, Moorish Ruffian, dark muffin, dark prince, and crazy. Stereotypical remarks that reduce women to brainless sexual objects and insult transvestites, dwarves, black people, and men in general. Harlem is said to be a ghetto. Many sexual references including the F-word were removed from the original US unrated version to make the film get a PG-13 rating."

Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2	PG	1	1	1	0	1	No sex or nudity. No blood or gore, but there is a lot of slapstick humor. Very brief smoking, but there is no drug or alcohol in the film.  No swearing, although; there is a little bit of mild name calling.

The Hottie & the Nottie	PG-13	4	3	2	1	1	Paris Hilton is seen in lingerie and tight fitting clothes. Shirtless males are seen on the beach playing volleyball whilst Paris Hilton jogs past in tight fitting spandex. One shirtless male sitting on a beach bench whilst as Paris Hilton jogs past in tight fitting spandex. A sex scene with Christine Lakin in lingerie with a shirtless male model Johann Urb who is then seen again shirtless at a door. Comic violence. A woman has an infected toenail, which eventually flies into a man's mouth. A man is given electric shocks as part of a hypnosis experiment. Cole drinks a bottle of whiskey. June drinks a wine cooler. Plenty of gross out humor, June's appearance will disgust viewers. 1 F-word, including a couple uses of shit, damn, hell and asshole.

House of the Dead	R	6	19	5	4	1	Sexual activity is limited to amorous twentysomethings writhing, kissing and groping each other fully clothed. In one case, a couple making out in the woods is attacked by monsters before they can get very far. There is, however, a significant amount of breast nudity in the early going. One girl at the rave is topless. We see a home video recording of another later on. A girl goes for a swim at a secluded beach. She strips to a thong and is shown otherwise naked for the next few minutes. Dancers wear provocative outfits. Most of the human deaths are surprisingly restrained. Not a lot of gore. The victims are simply swarmed by zombies. An exception finds a young man bleeding from the mouth before a zombie arm bursts through his back and out his stomach. The undead, however, bite the dust in large numbers and extremely graphic fashion (usually to the tune of gangsta rap or loud techno music). Creatures are hacked with axes and shot at close range. Others get picked off in hails of automatic weapons fire. Blood sprays. Limbs fly. Heads explode or get crushed underfoot. Grenades and dynamite take out more still. Some of the evil dead are more human than others, including those adolescent party animals who havent decomposed much in the past few hours (perhaps all of that alcohol helped to preserve them; we dont know). Regardless, seeing people forced to kill their zombified friends is more disturbing than watching them whack a faceless corpse. For example, a rabid Cindy attacks her peers and is sent flying by a blast, then put down for good with a bullet to the forehead. A mans hand is impaled. Another has his neck broken. A man is hanged. A zombie tries to drown a woman. A boys face is severely burned. A man gets stabbed in the face. A sword fight ends with a girl being run through and her foe being decapitated. Beer is the beverage of choice. Guys drink it on the way to the rave. Couples carry bottles of brew with them as they prepare to have sex. Upon arriving at the deserted party, Greg and Simon are so single-mindedly drawn to the unsupervised keg and other booze that they dont worry a bit where everyone is or why the place is trashed. Kirk drinks from a flask and smokes cigars. Most of the movie is gory and violent, which could disturb some. Creatures pop into view from the wings and are picked off as they do. Several people sacrifice themselves for the good of the group. The zombies may frighten some young viewers. 19 f*** words

Son of the Mask	PG	1	8	2	0	1	At a Halloween office party, some women are wearing skimpy costumes, one in particular is ogled by the Mask and spun into a skimpier costume while other women are put into new outfits with open shirts showing their bras. Loki shoots at Tim repeatedly in various scenes, with cartoonish excess. Otis the dog tries to give Alvey a firecracker disguised as a rattle; Alvey gives it back disguised as a bone and it blows up the dog. Alvey and Otis the dog fight violently (at one point swinging the dog by the tail so he hits all the walls in the room, smashing furniture, etc. and then blows the dog up after it surrenders with a white flag -- this sequence is very violent, though all cartoonish). Otis the dog imagines putting a bomb in Alvey's diaper, shooting him out of a cannon, spinning him in a ceiling fan, and tarring and feathering him. Alvey turns all this around and does it to the dog, including sending him through one of those laundry wringers, flattening him (but both are okay afterwards). Loki, Tim, and Alvey fight violently, using guns, electricity, explosives, and garbage dumpsters (Alvey works magic to slam Loki between them). They look charred at times (in a cartoon fashion, but are otherwise okay later). Loki wields a giant axe, and later, a hammer, smashing the sidewalk around Tim. Loki throws an oversized hand grenade at Tim and Alvey; and the baby puts up a shield. There's a boxing match between Tim as the Mask and Loki. Otis the dog, while under the influence of the mask, bites someone's crotch. At a nightclub, background characters hold drinks. At a nightclub, some characters may be smoking in the background, while a girl in a skimpy costume sells cigarettes  4 uses of hell and damn 6 uses of crap

Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas	PG	0	2	0	1	1	 Very brief and non-explicit violence. Kirk says that Santa Claus beats the crap out of non-believers and people who went against the church, but this is more surreal and strange than violent.  None. 1 use of crap

Epic Movie	PG-13	5	12	3	2	7	"Sexual content throughout the film including implied sex and sex references. Audra Lynn steps out of a closet wearing a bikini. She is fully nude in the unrated version. We see breasts and shaved pubic area. Her breasts bounce as she runs. A guy and girl walk in on an old man and young girl in bed. The girl jumps out of bed topless in panties and runs off. A man is seen jogging and the shape of his penis can be seen through his shorts. It is implied that a man is a pedophile. All the violence in this film is slapstick and done for laughs and contains no gore. A big battle scene, with many people being killed. No blood and done for laughs. A mans arm is snapped and the bone sticks out. A man is stabbed with a spear. A woman kicks a beaver on two occasions. A man is hit in the balls with a sledgehammer and two balls fall out. It is implied that they are his balls. A woman gets her tongue stuck to a lamp post and cuts it off. She is fine though. A woman's head is kicked off. A mans neck is broke. A man uses a young man's wounded body to knock down two guards. Some snakes attack people briefly. A woman is grabbed and thrown out of the plane, and she crashes on top of a woman on a pavement crushing her (we see the body crumple and it is obvious that it is a stuffed doll). Casual drinking throughout the film A character appears to be inebriated throughout the film. A woman who is pregnant is shown smoking and a young woman and man smoke cigarettes after they apparently have had sex. (Deleted. Personal opinions about ratings are not appropriate for the Parents Guide.) People may find some scenes gross. 9 uses of goddamn 10 uses of bitch 7 uses of shit 1 with dumb 3 uses of hell 12 uses of ass 1 with hole 1 with dumb 1 use of fuck, pussy and prick 1 F-word, 1 obscene hand gesture, 3 sexual references, 8 scatological terms, 10 anatomical terms, 16 mild obscenities, 7 religious profanities and 4 religious exclamations. Name calling (freak, dumb and stupid.) In the Unrated Edition: 10 or more uses of ""fuck"" ""White Bitch"" is said quite often as one of the main Villains is named this. Many other suggestive/sexual things are said, like most movies which make fun of others."

Battlefield Earth	PG-13	5	3	3	4	2	"There are a couple implications that the female alien psychlos are only treated like sex objects. Concubines are briefly mentioned by the main villain It is implied that the main villain had a sexual relationship with a senator's daughter An alien woman sticks out an unnaturally long tongue and licks a man's cheek in a suggestive manner. Few minor kissing scenes. The main villain guns down several cows including shorting the legs off in an attempt to frighten the humans. A fair amount of explosions and gunshots, with some spontaneous deaths and clear view of some dead bodies. Little to no blood. The climax contains much destruction and fiery loss of life. The main villian's (Terl and his clerk named Ker) get intoxicated in a handful of scenes. Some characters smoke cigarettes in some scenes. They are so many scenes in which Terl and his friends drink green alien alcoholic beverages at a bar. The way the villains enslave and torment humans can be extremely unsettling. The CGI is terrible, so that might unsettle some people A small step above Star Trek-level sci-fi action intensity. The antagonistic race and the main villain in particular show a discomforting lack of empathy and concern for the lives of their subordinate human captives and even each other, leading to several ""pointless"" deaths. One scene has the main villain laughing while two humans wrestle over one oxygen mask in an inhospitable atmosphere. Some occasional profanity like Damn, Hell, and Crap Terl says ""Well, I'll be damned"" in one scene."

Pledge This!	R	2	1	1	1	3	"Lots of sexual jokes, there are several nude scenes throughout the unedited version of the movie A man and a woman have sex she is wearing a bra and he is naked and wearing a construction uniform thrusting and sexual remarks are heard while a girl is under the bed it's played for comedy Very, very little Two women and a man walk into a bathroom. The man looks drunk. The movie and its acting is frightening. One character is continually referred to as ""Baby d*ck"". Two uses of f**k Several uses of s**t"

Alone in the Dark	R	3	30	2	19	2	"There is one overt sex scene, yet both parties go through the motions without removing anything that would expose sensitive areas. No nudity A woman climbs into bed with a man, she's in a bra, she sits on top of him, then he rolls her over and he thrusts briefly. They are both semi-covered with sheets. Frequent and extreme graphic violence. The movie involves supernatural animalistic creatures: four legged beings with large teeth, jaws and claws, they have long tails with spines and are covered in armor-like shells. Many humans look and act like zombies: they have ashen skin, darkened eyes, and they are snarling, lunging, etc. A man discovers a woman twitching on the ground, and we see that her head has been split in half, with lots of blood pouring out, and the man turns around and is surrounded by snarling creatures that apparently attack him (we hear him yell). A man opens a large chest, we hear loud growling and snapping, we hear men screaming, and then we see many dead men with blood around and on them, and one man with a hole through his chest. Many snarling and growling creatures run through dark woods toward people, many armed people shoot at the creatures, some of them are hit, and some people are attacked; we see bodies being flung through the air, and we hear screamings. A man's heavily armed commandos prepare themselves for an onslaught of alien-type monsters that are rapidly approaching. They then open fire on the creatures, killing many of them, but some get through and attack and kill the commandos. Helicopter gun ships then arrive and open fire on the monsters, but one manages to cause one chopper to crash into the other and both explode (presumably killing everyone onboard both). A man is attacked by a creature that pulls his arm and part of his chest off (we hear squishing, and see blood and matter as the man slumps to the ground and dies). Lights flicker on and off in a museum, a man investigates with a flashlight, a creature rears up behind him, grabs his head in its claw and squeezes, then pokes a claw through the back of the man's head and out his mouth, killing him. His bloody corpse is found by a man and a woman. A man falls through an opening in the floor and is impaled on many spikes below (we see his bloody body); a large stone slab falls crushing him and we see blood oozing from under the stone. A man jumps from a crosswalk onto another man, they fight, one is thrown through a window, and the other man jumps through the window and tackles him, knocking his head against the floor. A man is shot in the head and a man holds three other people at gunpoint. A man is hit in the chest by a thrown knife. Many armed people shoot at creatures. We see creatures being hit with matter splattering, and we see people being attacked with matter splattering as they are impaled by creatures' spiked claws and tails. Many infected people attack armed people. We see one infected person punching a hole in a man's chest, another infected person breaks a man's neck, and some infected people are shot, and others are impaled (one is impaled rather slowly). Several infected people attack a man; he shoots them, one is hit with an axe, a creature breaks a door down, chases the man and a woman, and the man shoots it and it turns into a cloud of dust. A man hits another man on the head, grabs his grenade and pulls the pin. The resultant explosion kills them and destroys a generator. A man and a woman hide in a room, a creature finds them, begins to break the door down, pokes a claw through the door cutting the woman's arm (we see some blood), and the man shoots it. A man finds his wife lying unconscious on the floor; he is attacked by the man who killed her, he holds him down, chokes him, and drops a worm-like parasite into his mouth. A doctor performs an autopsy on a man. We see his chest with a large incision and metal devices holding it open, and he pulls out something that had been attached to his spinal column (it looks like a worm with legs) and it is severed. The doctor performs a scan on another man's spinal cord and it has it too. A woman falls injuring her leg (we see blood on her pant leg), a snake slithers in the sand under and around her and other people shoot at it; the woman is apparently injured somehow and she dies. A man jabs a creature with a needle, draws blood, and injects himself in the arm with it (we see the insertion and blood trickles on his arm). A large explosion underground sends flames shooting through passageways. A group of dead people is seen lying on the ground, blood is everywhere. Two cabs race through traffic, one rams the other, they drive through a marketplace causing damage, one crashes, and the other rams into its side twice; the driver has a bloody face and head and the passenger jumps out. Two men fight. One of them is kicked by the other and crashes onto a window, then punches the other man in the face and slams his head on the ground. They keep fighting, and one of them before escaping crashes an object on the opponent's head, who runs after him. He then shoots the other man twice in the chest (bloody holes are seen), but the man is still alive and keeps running after him. He is shoot again, this time in a leg; the two men keep fighting, one tries to choke the other, but ends up impaled (bloody and graphic). A man hits another man in the stomach with a mallet. A woman punches another man hard in the face. Two men yell at each other, shove each other briefly and are pulled apart by other men. We hear about the mysterious disappearance of 20 children from an orphanage. Laboratory experiments having been conducted on them. Some of the characters smoke frequently. None. Alone in the Dark is a horror movie filled to the brim with frequent and extreme graphic violence and gore throughout. Almost every character in this movie is killed in very stylized and gruesome manners, mostly impalement. There are various monsters and grisly images throughout. A sudden sound might startle some viewers. A figure suddenly passes by in the foreground of a dimly lit scene. A claw-like appendage grabs a man by the head (with blood coming out from where it's pinching his skull), with another piece suddenly thrusting out through his mouth from the back of his head. A manhole type cover in a mine tunnel suddenly gives way beneath a man, sending him plummeting to his death below. A monster suddenly attacks a man, tearing off his arm. There is a brief footage of men chasing after an orphan boy through the woods and him then hiding in an electrical substation at night. We see some monsters (a cross between wolves and the creatures in ""Aliens"") in the reflection of a boy's eye. We hear the sounds of monster violence on the other side of a closed door, as a man tries to keep that door from opening. The lights in a museum flicker and then keep going on and off as a security guard slowly makes his way through the building that's filled with various large artifacts, some of which might look scary in the on and off lighting. In another part of that same museum, Edward and Aline also slowly make their way through it. A man slowly makes his way through a building as the lights flicker about him. Sand worms/snakes slither through the sand toward an injured woman. One bites her and another woman holds off another one that's surfaced, with a man and others shooting and presumably killing all of them. A lone female commando slowly makes her way through the dark, knowing monsters may be lurking anywhere. We see a massive subterranean chamber with swarms of monsters headed toward some lone survivors. They then race away, but one returns to make an explosive work to kill the creatures. We see the sudden point of view of something rapidly racing toward two survivors who turn around just as it reaches them, but the scene ends there. Many scenes are creepy and can be frightnening to children. The supernatural and monstrous creatures may scare young viewers. There is some strong language, but it's pretty sparse. 7 F-words, 12 scatological terms, 4 anatomical terms, 6 mild obscenities, 4 religious profanities, 4 religious exclamations."

Dragonball Evolution	PG	6	10	2	5	3	A teenage boy imagines a teenage girl eating a strawberry seductively. Very mild. A magazine featuring bikini models is found in an old man's trunk. However he dismisses it as being a collectors edition. A young woman and young man are about to kiss but are distracted. A teenage boy and girl embrace and kiss. Very mild. When master roshi tries to catch bulma he grabs her butt and later he lets her down. Woman plays with a dragon ball in front of her cleavage. A few characters are shot in the film with blaster guns, though no blood is shown. Although not graphic or gory, Goku as Oozaru starts to strangle an incapacitated Roshi. Several teenage boys try to fight one other boy but he dodged their attacks and they hit each other instead. Two identical women fight, as one has copied the appearance of the other. A man interrupts and knocks one of the woman out, and the other woman runs away. The climactic fight between two fighters involved some fired projectiles and punches and kicks. Fairly brief and no blood. A ape looking creature attacks several people and kills a man, but no blood or gore. There is some mild bloodshed shown in a few of the fights. There is a scene where a house falls on someone, killing them. We see the corpse. Not in detail though. Goku fights and kill scary creatures, throws their bodies in lava, and race across the bodies to get to the other side. Since they're monstrous creatures, their blood and tissue is green and inhuman. None of the martial arts fight scenes are very graphic or violent. There is a scene where we see a few teens drinking what is implied to be alcohol at a party. We see a character smoking a pipe in one brief scene. The opening monologue mentions a time in the past of great destruction and death. A village is shown destroyed and a woman hunts another woman and young girl. This is quite disturbing. The main character sees visions of the future that include destruction and scary images. An ape looking monster is meant o be scary and is quite destructive. There fighting throughout is sometimes intense. 'H*ll' is said a few times. 'D*mn' is said a few times. 'Sh*t' is said once.

From Justin to Kelly	PG	3	1	1	0	1	"No graphical nudity or sex scene show in this movie. Some women at the beach are shown wearing bikinis, but nothing too raunchy. A whipped cream bikini contest is held, and some women are shown in whipped cream bikinis. Two hovercrafts collide, resulting in one driver being thrown into the surf. He's pulled out and we see a slight cut (a tiny bit of blood) over his eye (we later hear he got several stitches for that). We see beer bottles on tables in the bar where Kelly works. A local guy, Luke, asks Kelly if she wants to go out for a couple of beers and she comments on him passing out in the past.  At least 6 hells and 1 use each of ""God"" and ""For the love of God"" as exclamations."

Meet the Spartans	PG-13	7	4	2	3	2	"Lots of sexual and homosexual innuendeo throughout. A non-explicit sex scene in which characters faces are shown with orgasmic expressions. A woman shows off her chastity belt. Women wear suggestive/revealing outfits and a nearly nude scene of a woman ""wearing"" only a few vegetables. A man's buttocks are shown. Several scenes in which the camera zooms on a woman's crotch to show a pixelated (censored) area. In a scene a man presses a woman's breast for a few seconds,to recognize her. Some fights/violence which is mostly comical though includes a decapitation and impalements on swords and spears. But no blood is seen. A man is shown with a small wound on his face from which blood squirts out of. While dancing, a man's neck snaps but it is shown briefly. A very fake-looking penguin starts beating up (also fake-looking) a man. People are seen drinking alcohol. There is no smoking in this film. The scene at the beginning where a penguin fart's and poops on Leonidas's face is quite gross. A woman has a huge arm, because of an ""infection,"" a man stabs a sword on it and it explodes into ooze, like pimples and zits. Cringy Scene. The part were Leonidas finishes his dance during a dance-off, we see him break his neck and opened his head, but is still ok. This could disgust some people. 1 F-word, 12 sexual references, 13 scatological terms(shit) (1 mild), 15 anatomical terms(ass), 18 mild obscenities, 1 religious exclamation. Name-calling (cracker, idiot, dumb, ugly.)"

Gigli	R	11	5	0	4	2	"We see a woman in the shower with her bare back and parts of her breast A woman is lesbian and has a relationship with another man. A man and a woman talk in detail about the differences between the male and female sex organs and debate which is the ultimate sex organ. A woman kisses a man, pinches his nipple, invites him to perform cunnilingus on her, they kiss, he lies on top of her, and then she rolls him over and climbs on top of him; she takes his shirt off, they kiss and she thrusts her hips rhythmically. A man takes off his shirt and flexes in front of a mirror, and a man takes off his robe and stretches in front of a woman. There is a painting of a woman in a bathing suit (cleavage is evident). When Larry tells his mom that Ricki is a lesbian, his mom says she can tell Ricki has been with guys before. She then adds that she (the mom) used to be quite experimental in her youth. When wanting to speak to Ricki, Louis tells Larry, ""Put the clam-licker on."" A drawing of a woman shows cleavage. Ricki and Larry discuss sex explicitly, while she does yoga in a revealing outfit. Ricki and Larry have sex, with her on top. A man takes a gun another man was wearing and waves it around as he discusses an issue. He then shoots that other man in the forehead, killing him (with bloody results as we see blood run down the dead man's face from the hole as well as blood splatter on the front of an aquarium and some sort of bloody human tissue floating in the aquarium that a fish eats). A man goes to cut off a corpse's thumb in a morgue (to be used in place of another man). We see him starting to saw at the thumb with a scalpel and then hear the rest of the sawing sound (there's no blood). A woman takes a large kitchen knife and slits her wrists (seen), with resultant blood flow. Everyone around her panics and sends her to the hospital where she disappears from the story. This scene could be unwatchable for some viewers. A man threatens to put a gagged man through a spin in an industrial clothes dryer (to make him talk, and he's already in it). 2 strong graphic images (bloody)  The characters seem to get angry and yell with no real resolution to them; probably 'cuz of how poor the film is - ridiculed with plot holes. We see an intest scene where a woman slits her wrists and dissapears in the story. Various characters have varying degrees of bad attitudes, including one who murders another and others who kidnap an autistic young man (some of whom use disparaging terms about his condition). A woman attempts to commit suicide by slitting her wrists (seen with blood) while a person cuts off a corpse's thumb (no blood, but potentially disturbing). The scene where the man gets shot in the head is pretty disturbing, largely due to the fact that it's unexpected. It occurs late in the film, which up to that point has been fairly light and comical. A song has at least 1 use of the ""f"" word in it. Severe language! 124 F-words and its derivatives, 13 sexual references, 18 scatological terms, 20 anatomical terms, 5 mild obscenities, 1 religious profanity, 11 religious exclamations, 2 derogatory term for the mentally challenged, 5 derogatory terms for homosexuals."

Foodfight!	PG	6	6	2	4	4	Multiple innuendos throughout, which are pretty explicit Butts naked Their is a strip club scene. A woman caresses a dog, and they dance sexually together. A squirrel stares at a woman's bare breasts, this shot is a POV, so the audience sees as well with their eyes. There is a cat with human breasts. this may look real, but they are in fact belonging to tom Ashford Russell. Extreme scenes of gore and violence, such as scenes of decapitation. Someone gets slapped. Their is a flashback scene in which the main male lead gets circumcised, though the scene is cast in shadows, so it is not as graphic as it could have been, though it is still very disturbing. Characters are shown being executed, via decapitation throughout the film, but there is no gore. The final battle does reference Naziism The villain attacks an old man at one point. Frequent and copious hard drug use and references. Milk is served at this bar that a character owns and its treated as it were alcohol. Due to this film's animation style some characters might look creepy to some viewers. The scene with the boobs will give you nightmares. 2 planes crash into each other in the sky. A burning human hand is seen falling right out of the sky. This is the most shocking scene in the film One character's plane crashes into a house. One use of 'arse' Many Racial slurs throughout Many sexual innuendoes are used throughout. Crude and explicit jokes are used throughout.

Date Movie	PG-13	3	3	1	1	1	"A woman comes out of a pool dressed in a bikini and acts all seductive. Then she takes off her bikini and sits on a deck chair completely naked. Nothing is shown. A man and a woman have sex on an elevator, and the woman bounces up and down while he holds her legs around his waist. After a man and a woman have sex, they see an older woman in the apartment across from them, and it is apparent that she was watching them, and she makes overtures to the man. Long scene of a cat farting and pooping (poop not seen) on a toilet. All violence is comical. A man shoots himself with a nail gun after seeing an obese woman dancing. People drink wine with a meal. A cat smokes and numbers run across the screen indicating that a woman is a heavy smoker (1142 a day) and drinker (the ""Tara Reid Status""). A cat is on the toilet and screeches. 7 uses of shit"

Cats	PG	2	1	0	3	1	"There is absolutely no nudity, though there may be innuendo and some hip shaking, ala a certain ""King"" of Rock and Roll. Cats are seemingly humanised and sexualised in the way the move and walk and talk Lots of fighting, with cats frequently slashing at each other.  The cat CGI may appear to be weird and uncanny to many viewers. The way the cats look could also possible creep out some viewers. CGI may confuse or 'creep' out very young audiences but no frightening or intense scenes Correct use of the word ""hell"" in a song (most of the song lyrics are all taken from old English modernism poetry). Line: Are you a alumnus of Heaven or Hell. Referring to the way a cat is good and evil."

Baby Geniuses	PG	2	0	1	1	1	"Babies are seen without shirts, and almost completely without bottoms on (which means they are left running around bare-legged in their diapers all the time.) Also, when Sly is running from babyco and looking for a disguise, he ends up in a female babies stroller. He asks her to take her clothes off and she responds: ""not so fast, slick. You'll have to take me to dinner first."" Very little if at all. There is some physical humour involving certain sensitive parts of the male anatomy.  A toddler is briefly captured by a homeless man smoking a cigar (or at least with one in his mouth it doesn't appear lit) and when escaping, he takes the mans clothes for a disguise, including the cigar. The titular babies can frighten many people, kids included Mild name calling, but it may offend some."

Glitter	PG-13	2	1	1	1	1	"Man and woman kiss and are seen behind a glass partition in his bedroom. He removes her clothing and and lies on top of her on the bed. They are then seen post coitus lying naked under covers. Only nudity includes bare-chested male. The long gown the protagonist wears during the Madison Square Garden concert is translucent with some parts of her body visible underneath. A brief glimpse of a man beating another man on the street is seen before police stop him. A news report later states man was hospitalized. A man is shot in the chest on the street and later reported dead. Some smoking. Some of the thematic elements may upset younger viewers. There is not a lot of profanity in this movie maybe 3 or 4 uses of the word ""shit"" and, no more than 10 ""hell""s or ""damn""s."

BloodRayne	R	3	1	1	1	1	Rayne's outfit is partially revealing showing her cleavage and stomach Two scenes of nudity. One when Rayne comes out of her cell and has sex with a man. You can clearly see her breasts for a long time and parts of her back. The man licks her nipple. He is shown thrusting into her and moaning is heard. This scene lasts for about 3 minutes In the director's cut, there is a scene in the vampire's castle. He is surrounded by fully naked women and full nudity is shown. Almost all the scenes in the movie has fight scenes and they include everything from throat-slitting to beheading. There are a few scenes with torn dead bodies hanging and vampired eating the flesh from them. Drinking There are a lot of these (frightening for kids). This includes Vampires eating flesh and killing people to throat slitting and beheading with sprays of blood all around. Bitch and tits are used once

Cosmic Sin	R	1	0	0	0	1	A man and a woman kissing briefly    38 f*** words and other profanity

Left Behind	PG-13	1	18	6	4	1	"Main plot point involves the infidelity of a married man with a coworker and his planned excursion to London to be with his lover and attend a music concert. A woman agrees to take her little brother to the mall where a loud jolt shakes the ground and people scream; the woman is left hugging her little brother's empty clothing and panics, gasping and running as other people all around her cry and run, looking for lost loved ones; we see that all the children and many adults have vanished, leaving their clothing, jewelry and any possessions they carried while men begin looting the clothing for money and the stores for TVs; a driverless car crashes loudly through large windows and into the food court, stopping amid a pile of broken glass and we see a woman's arm hanging out the passenger window; in the parking lot, a single engine plane without a pilot crashes onto the pavement and slides into a car; no one appears hurt, but we hear a loud BOOM and see flames engulfing the plane. Two men accost a woman and they all struggle over her purse while a man is blown through a loudly shattering glass door by a shotgun blast and falling on his back to the sidewalk, dead and with blood on his jacket; a man walks out and points the shotgun at a woman who raises her hands over her head and then walks away; along another street, people sit, crying and holding possessions left by vanished loved ones while two women cry over empty baby buggies and one woman cries over an empty baby romper in her hands. A motorcyclist grabs a purse from a walking woman's shoulder and a completely empty school bus rolls off a bridge overhead into a creek a few yards away (no one is hurt). A traffic jam blocks a street outside a mall and we see that many of the cars are completely empty; a woman driver cries, a man leans out of his pickup truck and shouts for everyone to move their cars out of his way and two EMT vehicles cross in the background with sirens sounding. A woman uses a metal sign stand to shatter the glass of a side door entrance to a hospital and she crawls through the glass on the floor gingerly (no blood); she finds the nursery completely empty of babies and a nurse's uniform crumpled on the floor as a woman with swollen red eyes yanks open a curtain and walks out to the first woman, stating that the babies and nurses all vanished. On an airliner, a woman pulls a handgun, points it at people, cries and screams several times that her ex-husband paid everyone to take her missing daughter, that someone put something in her drink to knock her out so the girl could be taken off the plane; other people scream and hide behind seats and the woman points the gun at her own chest but does not pull the trigger, as a reporter takes the gun and a man says that his sick mother died when he was a child and that he arrived home and found her dead, leaving him as upset as the gun-toting woman is now. A sad woman climbs to the top of a bridge at dusk, talks to her vanished mother and leans forward to jump to her death but stops when her cell phone rings and a male friend is on the line; she speaks with him and her father, whom she thought was dead, and climbs down to safety. A woman uses a truck, a pavement-rolling machine and a pickup truck to clear a makeshift runway and pours a can of gasoline at the end of the road lighting it up as a beacon for an airplane to land; the plane shakes and jolts as it glides down and lands hard, with massive sparks, screeching and red-hot wheels before stopping a few feet from a fuel tank truck, while a chemical station halfway back down the road ignites in large flames; a flight attendant puts out an inflated rubber exit ramp and helps people slide to the ground while a man kicks a person down the ramp when the person hesitates (no one is injured). Two people argue several times about how many gods there are; one person rifles the other man's flight bag, the man grabs it back, takes a toothbrush and points it shouting that he has no weapons. A woman argues with another woman who was berating a reporter in an airport terminal about Bible prophecy coming true. A woman's mother warns her that earthquakes are fulfilling Biblical prophecy; the daughter is cynical about God and stomps out of the house. A wooden sign on a street reads, ""The end is HERE."" In a church a woman finds the pastor left behind alone and she argues with him about God; he says that the vanished people went to Heaven for protection against seven years of evil and she screams at him and stomps out. A man and a woman argue about the existence of God and the man says he can no longer think of having a relationship with the woman; she becomes angry and stalks away. A hospital is overrun with new patients; we see no blood except a scratch on a man's forehead, but many people lie on gurneys and one man is holding his arm and grimacing. A woman walks home and finds it empty; she picks up a ball bat and looks around, screaming as the phone rings and she hears a recorded message when she answers it; the woman's mother and little brother have vanished and when she checks voicemail on her mother's phone she hears her pilot dad sending a Mayday signal, followed by some muffled crashing noises (she gasps, thinking he is dead) and she finds the shower running in the bathroom with her mother's jewelry lying under the spray. A man rifles through a vanished flight attendant's bag, tossing things to the floor until he breaks down crying when he sees a watch engraved with ""John 3:16"" and the words ""Bible Study!!!"" on a calendar page. All children and 1/3 of adults on a commercial airliner disappear, leaving their clothing folded in their seats and jewelry lying on top of their garments; some remaining passengers cry, others argue about what is happening and a man becomes angry whenever anyone looks at him, asking if they want to insult his size while a pilot instructs the passengers to remain seated and speaks loudly to an unruly man; several other men stand and pound on the cockpit door, but seat themselves after the pilot berates them to sit down and buckle up. A woman pulls out a baggie of crystal meth in a airplane bathroom. A woman on a plane shakes and shivers in her seat and runs to the bathroom where she looks into the mirror and says, ""It's a bad trip. You've had them before"" (referring to drug use.) A reporter sees injection track marks on a woman's arm. A bottle of wine is shown in a corner of a kitchen counter in a house. A flight attendant carries a bottle of champagne to the service area in the front of a plane. An airline passenger calls for a Scotch that we never see. Destruction images. When the Rapture occurs, people disappear, causing general panic. There's a minor plane collision and an intense, forced plane landing, with lots of fire. Viewers hear a story of a woman and children who died in a flood. Chloe says the ""s"" word, under her breath in a scene near the end (steamroller). It's very hard to make out, and not in the subtitles."

Jack and Jill	PG	14	10	3	0	3	"At the beginning of the movie, they show alot of sets of twins. One set says that as she was coming out of her mom, she kicked her twin inside her mom. Jill refers to the movie Pretty Woman, and says ""the one where she's a hooker"" Women on a cruise ship wear skimpy bikinis. Elsewhere we see very low-cut dresses and other revealing tops. A woman at a New Year's Eve party reports, ""I'm not wearing any underwear."" Another woman announces that she works at Hooters, as she grabs her clothed chest. Jill makes comments about two ""hookers"" at a party. And at Felipe's picnic, she dances and shakes her clothed breasts. An old man in the crowd grabs her backside. Another guy manages to look up her skirt, reporting to his friend, ""It's not a guy."" When thinking about a good user name for a dating site, Jill says, ""How about Manilow? 'Cause he can use me anytime."" Later, after Jill fails to receive any responses on the site, Jack secretly posts a sexual innuendo-laden ad on Craigslist to stir up lots of responses for her. But Jill balks at Jack's suggestion that she date Al Pacino, saying, ""All he wants to do is play Twister with your sister!"" Pacino smirks over the phone, ""I can smell horny across an ocean!"" In desperation, Jack scrambles into a public bathroom and dresses up as his sister to have a date with Pacino. He fills her bra with two cantaloupes, and when he steps out of the stall, the bathroom attendant motions him over and adjusts his melons so they look right. Later, Jill is standing in the hallway and the bathroom attendant spots her and mistakenly gives her another adjustment. Jill immediately punches the attendant back through the bathroom door. An inebriated Jack punches Pacino in the face, and Pacino returns the favor, breaking a chair across Jack's back. A drunken woman puts Erin in a headlock and starts swinging her around. Jill steps in, throwing the woman into a wall and punching her in the face. While staying with Jack's family, Jill wants to go with them to a number of fun activitiesand the results are almost always disastrous. When the kids ride on ponies, Jill insists that she's not too heavy to join them and crushes the pony flat. Then they visit The Price Is Right and Jill knocks herself out with the big prize wheel. She rides the family's Sea-Doo in the pool and flies up out of the water, crashing down on the lawn furniture. At Thanksgiving dinner, talk turns to the sometimes physical connection between twins. Jill starts slapping herself in the face to see if Jack can feel it. He says he can't, so Gary slugs her on the jaw and knocks her backward off her chair. ""Did you feel that, Daddy?"" the kid gleefully asks. At the picnic, Felipe's bug-eyed grandma gets pummeled repeatedly as Jill's shoe flies off and conks her, and a swinging broom handle knocks her out cold. People (and the cockatoo) are seen drinking bottled beer, mixed drinks and/or Jack Daniel's on a cruise ship. Wine and spirits show up at a party and several dinners. Jack (pretending to be Jill) slugs back quite a lot of the hard stuff on his ""date"" with Al.  1 use of ""Crap"" and 1 use of ""Damn"" Two uses of hell and God's name is inappropriately interjected more than a dozen times. Name-calling includes freak, weirdo, psycho, annoying, loser, stupid and rat face."

Rollerball	PG-13	2	2	0	0	0	In a mixed shower, women's naked upper bodies are shown. Male nudity is absent. Some scenes where breasts are visible but no male nudity. A man is violently hit in the face with a iron ball. Nothing too graphic. Some other shooting and fighting scenes not too graphic.   

Catwoman	PG-13	2	1	0	1	1	A man and woman kiss. Very brief. Halle Berry as a catwoman wore a dress that reveals navel and waist. The catwoman costume shows a lot of cleavage, and the pants are ripped showing lots of skin. Stylized action violence featuring punching and kicking, all done in a highly unrealistic and very cartoonish fashion.  Teens and up Bit*h is said once.

Kazaam	PG	2	1	0	0	0	Kazaam was in bed with the main character, but nothing wrong happens, but the word pervert is used. Shaq bathes in front of him. Shaq also kisses the main character on the lips multiple times out of joy that he is alive, but still PRETTY awkward... Max is terrorized by a gang of bullies   

Slender Man	PG-13	3	1	2	3	3	"2 teenagers make out/kiss each other for 10 or so seconds before being interrupted. A few minutes later they go to make out again but get interrupted before making contact. Nothing further happens. It's implied that 4 girls watched porn over at a sleepover. We never see or hear this, only implied. Mention of a ""circle jerk"" jokingly to a group of guys Slender Man has some violence but nothing graphic or bloody. There was supposed to be a scene of a girl stabbing herself in the eye, needles going in eyes in split video scenes of Slender Man video, there was supposed to be a suicide scene also. But many scenes that were too scary or graphic had to be cut for a ""PG-13 rating"" it wasn't the movie we were supposed to get. 4 girls drink a bunch of vodka once there at a sleepover Katie's father is an alcoholic and is almost always drunk on screen. This causes Katie great stress. The movie is chalked full of jumpscares. Will definitely scare easily scared viewers. Slender Man may be frightening for some viewers A girl while in her room receives a email on her phone that is revealed to be a recording of someone outside her house moving towards it in a first person perspective, she moves towards her door even as the mysterious figure slowly moves into her house and up the stairs towards her. A truly frightening scene that people who have experienced actual stalking will likely feel deeply disturbed by. 1 use of ""Jesus At least 5 uses of hell and which 1 use of hell appears on a text on a phone screen. 2 uses of the middle finger 2 uses of the F-word"

The Emoji Movie	PG	4	1	1	3	2	"Some flirting/ suggestive humor. No nudity and sex Two emojis kiss. Some mild flirting between emojis. Jailbreak threatens hi-5, saying that if he tells anyone a secret that she will ""crack more than his knuckles"" The beer emoji is seen. This is a family movie, so there's only very mild threat with an emoji deletion threat, and that is the worst of it. The part where the phone gets erased can scare some. There is a threat that all of the emojis will be deleted. The Poop emoji is about to say ""shit"" but is cut off before he can say it. There is no cursing but there is lots of mild language throughout the movie (Deleted. Personal opinions about ratings are not appropriate for the Parents Guide.)"

Vampires Suck	PG-13	8	23	5	2	4	"Jacob pees on a fire hydrant. A young man and a young woman sit on a bed, they kiss, he stops her, she climbs out of bed and removes her nightgown (she is wearing a black bra and panties, and both have flashing lights strategically placed over her nipples and pubic area) and she says, ""I want to go all the way."" A young man removes his shirt and pants (his crotch is blocked by the crowd and then a large disco ball when the camera moves in closer) and turns to show his back and we see his bare buttocks when he bends over. Four men wearing cutoff jeans and no shirts dance together and make suggestive moves toward each other. (This is rather comical) A man has an inflatable doll wearing a bikini. A young man is shown with a noticeable bulge in his pants, grabs it as he walks into a high school lunchroom, and a young woman appears impressed. Some sexually related dialogue in a few scenes. At the very end, Edward's naked rear is shown in a close-up filling the entire screen A girl beats up several other girls in a fountain. A teenage boy punches a teenage girl in the face by way of greeting A girl threatens another girl with a knife A vampire is seen biting a girl's neck in his profile picture All violence is exaggerated for comical effect: A young man is struck in the head with a baseball bat, his head separates from his body and crashes through a car window (we see the severed head with blood at the neck). Four men attack a vampire and pull his limbs off and then his head and throw it into the woods (we see the bloody stumps and tissue at the tear site). A young man is hit in the head with a book and his head is ripped off. A vampire bites a woman on the neck and blood sprays from the wound while the woman screams (a young woman in a passing car sees the attack). A vampire squirrel bites a vampire on the neck. A vampire sucks the blood from a young woman's arm (we see her shrivel but is then OK). A car skids toward a young woman, a young man leaps to her aid and slams another young man into the side of the car stopping it before it hits her; the young man is shown with a twisted neck and bones protruding, a broken arm with a bone sticking through the skin and blood at the tear (we see him later in a cast, neck and head brace). A young woman has a bloody finger after cutting herself on paper; blood spurts from the wound, she is thrown into a wall by a young man and we see that she has broken her arm and a bone is poking through the skin along with more spurting blood, which she pours into numerous champagne glasses from which two men drink. Three vampires attack a young woman and one bites her in the arm (we later see tooth marks and the vampire's teeth have actually remained attached to her arm). A young man shoots a young woman and she falls into a hole in the ground; the young man then throws a cell phone that hits the young woman in the head as she is trying to climb out of the hole (no blood is shown).

A young man is struck in the head with a bat covered with spikes and we see him lying on the ground with it sticking out of the side of his head (he's OK). A man punches another man in a wheelchair, who then kicks the other man in the face, and they fight: one is slammed onto the street, the other is pounded on with the wheelchair and they both end up with bloody, bruised, scratched faces and one man has several teeth broken off. A man punches another man in the nose, then in the jaw, and pinches his nipples (the man screams and we see his nose twisted out of shape). A young woman maces her father (we see his reddened eyes), she kicks him in the crotch and rips off his mustache (we see a bloody spot where his mustache used to be and he collapses onto the ground). A young man throws a young woman through the ceiling and she crashes back down through the roof; a satellite dish falls on her and then a pile of bricks (we see her lying on the floor and screaming). A young man juggles a baby, a bowling ball and an apple and we hear a thud when the bowling ball lands on top of the baby (we do not see the child injured). a vampire bites a human to drink her blood then she falls dead. A father leaves a note for his daughter that reads, ""The weed is in the top drawer."" A vampire drinks from a bottle of blood, a man guzzles beer from a tube. A young woman talks about ""binge drinking"" in a positive light. A man drinks wine. A young woman drinks from a bottle of champagne. None; comical violence. Vampires. A ""special edition Feel-Real dolly"" is shown in the unrated version, along with the mention that it is warmed up in the tub so it's not as creepy. A girl asks a rhetorical sexual question. At least 1 F-word, 1 obscene hand gesture, 6 sexual references, 14 scatological terms, 6 anatomical terms, 8 mild obscenities, 1 religious profanity, 5 religious exclamations. The Unrated version has more swearing in it, akin to the other unrated versions of Seltzerberg movies (eg, Disaster Movie). Name-calling (virgin, loser, lesbian, Canadians, evil blood sucker.)"

Steel	PG-13	1	11	2	0	4	"Flirting with Sparkey. Steel shoots a teenager point-blank during an action scene A terrorist is shot by a US Marine Navy Seal Trickshot Master. A super righteous American Soldier takes out a base full of terrorists with his bare fists. Part of the movie takes place in the Iraq war.

The Starving Games	PG-13	6	12	2	2	12	"two characters have sex in one scene, but the nudity is blocked out with censor blocks, this scene goes on for a minute. 5/10 When a woman reads out some cards to name the tributes the following names come up meant in context: Huge anus and feel my hooters. The President ""Snowballs"" says that everyone wants to see a lesbian love story and a group of college girls appear in the arena dancing eroticly. Their nipples then grow large In one of the help canisters that is recieved there is a long collection of multi-coloured condoms. There are also a number of other crude jokes made throughout the movie. 5/10 Some people in District 12 are shown eating their hands, with mustard, BCC sauce etc. When Kantmiss gives the ""Chicken pin"" to her sister, the pin accidentally stabs through her hand. Kantmiss' mouth bleeds extremely after she bit a gag bread. A young woman kicks a young man's butt hard. A man gives another man a wedgie while he is wearing a thong. His thong splits him in half. A woman is killed when an acne crème bottle is stabbed in her neck. A long bread is shot in a character's eye. A boy's back is seen seriously injured. Very disgusting to see. A young man holds a little girl and kicks her like a football in a tree, and she dies later. The Marvel characters blow up, as does the band LMFAO by stepping off the platforms too soon. There are many other ways the players are killed, usually with a bit of gore. 1/10 A man is seen drinking and throws the bottle. 2/10 None really.

(no blood is shown) A few people in a boat surrounded by fog are terrorized; two women are thrown through a window (they're supposeably dead), a knife floating in the air stabs a man in the eyes (it is dark that you can only see dark figures, no blood is shown), then the last man screams in horror (the screen ends that we don't see what happens). Little, if any. When they are in the hospital/morgue area, one of the dead bodies sits up and gets off the bed. His eyes are sewn shut. This movie isn't that frightening, but it still may be frightening to younger viewers. 1 use of Jesus, ass, sucks, oh my god, my god, god and freak 2 uses of damn 4 uses of shit 8 uses of hell

Dungeons & Dragons	PG-13	0	4	0	4	0	 Legions of dragons attack: they are shown flying and spitting out fireballs. One man is engulfed in flames when a fireball hits him. Some dragons of apparently different hue chase and fight each other. One dragon is shot with a huge arrow and drops down, eventually being impaled on the spiral of a minaret. A dragon gobbles up a man whole (the scene is quick, dark and murky so not much is evident). Another dragon is killed when a gate with pointy thingies at the bottom comes down hard on him; his blood oozes copiously, flowing down several steps. There are several fights, most involving fists and kicks, and a few with swords, torches and sticks. A man slashes at another man with a small knife, a man stabs a man in the foot, and a man is stabbed from behind and killed (after being punched several times; at one point his arm is twisted and we hear bones cracking). A man has a sword driven vertically into his chest and twisted several times as a form of torture. A man breaks another man's neck. A man scratches a girls' chest with one of his long nails; a little blood comes out of the small incision. A girl stabs a couple of men with two knives and a man attacks with a huge ax (the scenes are not graphic or gory). A man is stabbed and thrown off a tall building. A brawl breaks out in a tavern, with a lot of people running around hitting each other. A man falls into what looks like quicksand, and a man's facial skin ripples as if something's moving underneath (after this experience, there are red, somewhat enlarged veins evident around the man's ears). Several men get bruised after fights, there's a lot of property destruction (primarily dragon related) and some threatening by crossbows.  There are several dark, dank and spooky dungeons, and many dragons. A man goes through a maze and is confronted and almost done in by shooting flames, huge pendulums and rotating blades. We see several skeletons, one of whom can talk. Two reptilian-looking tentacles come out of a man's ears, writhe around menacingly and go back inside his head. In another scene, the tentacles come out and grab a girl by the ears. She proceeds to scream while the tentacles apparently transmit her thoughts to their owner. 

Black Christmas	PG-13	1	8	1	0	1	"Talks about rape in movie most sexual content is implied Someine is stabbed in the chest with an icicle; we see some blood on her sweater. Someone is strangled with Christmas lights, but the scene cuts pretty quickly. Someone is shot through the eye with an arrow, the impact and aftermath are both very briefly seen. Several of the hooded killers are killed by the girls. Someone has her neck abruptly snapped. It is very brief but graphic. Someone has a torch thrown at him and he is set ablaze. The campus security guard is stabbed in the back. Some blood due to punches, etc. A few scenes where characters are seen drinking.  One use of fuck. Some uses of shit. Milder language including damn, etc. Please Note: this comment has been edited. Originally it claimed words like ""s-t"" were used. This is not a word. To be useful as a Parents' Guide, parents need to know what is in the film, not what you think they are capable of hearing. If the language harmed you; don't come to the parents' guide. If it didn't, don't assume other parents can't handle it."

The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl 3-D	PG	4	29	1	5	3	"Lava Girl kisses Shark Boy on the cheek, and he sizzles. Shark Boy puts his arm around Lava Girl, and his arm sizzles and he pulls it away. Max's mom wears a low-cut top that reveals cleavage. Linus refers to Lavagirl as ""hot."" Lava Girl's leg pops off at the knee, she goes back for it and she sticks it back on (the leg does not seem to be artificial, but the reality where everything takes place is). Lava Girl melts into a puddle (she comes back to her normal form later). Lava Girl's feet are frozen into ice cubes. Lava Girl's head spins completely around and we hear a squish and a creak. Lava Girl touches Shark Boy on the arm and he sizzles. A character falls into water and is attacked by many sharks (we see him thrashing, but no blood or anything else; it's not clear if he survives or not). Brains fall from the sky and splat on the ground (we hear squishes and spurts when they hit). Brain matter also splatters on the screen. Linus' head inflates and he topples over. Sharkboy is zapped repeatedly by electric eels swimming beneath his feet, he is also chased by many electric eels in the water, he tries to swim away, they continue to zap him, and he sinks to the bottom motionless; Max touches the water and is shocked, and Lavagirl dives into the eel infested water and pulls Shark Boy to the surface. Max is zapped on the backside by an electric bolt. Sharkboy, Lavagirl and Max are locked in a cage. Sharkboy becomes very angry and his teeth become pointed (like a shark's teeth), and he uses them to tear apart the cage to free them. Max throws a journal at Linus hitting him in the head. Bullies throw paper balls at Max. Linus and his friends chase Max through the playground trying to get his dream journal, Max climbs up a rope ladder, he slips and hits his crotch on a rope, and he falls back and drops his dream journal on the ground -- Linus gets it. Max and Linus fight each other: one shoots piranhas at the other, who fends them off with bubbles. A large storm swirls in the ocean toward Sharkboy (aged 5) standing on a pier, it destroys the pier, we see him in a raft while the Sharkboy's father drifts in the other direction, and Sharkboy's raft is surrounded by sharks who actually protect him; he rides on the back of one shark and is taken into a cave where we hear that he grows up and begins to develop shark gills, fins and instincts. Max's parents are sucked into a large funnel cloud, but they are retrieved and brought out of it. A large funnel cloud blows and swirls toward a school building, the windows are blown out, and the children in a classroom fall to the floor under their desks. Sharkboy throws Lavagirl into a volcano, and she emerges shooting lava from her hands. A narrow walkway begins to melt under Lavagirl's feet, she sneezes, blowing Sharkboy back (he nearly falls off the walkway), and they rush across and get to the other side just as the walkway falls away. Max and Linus ride rock pillars that shoot up into the air, a rope bridge joins them, they walk out onto the bridge and it breaks; one catches the other as they fall, and they soar on wooden planks that spin like helicopters. Max climbs a tall ice column, he retrieves an ice crystal, he drops it to Lavagirl who catches it and she is turned into ice, and they are surrounded by guards. Lavagirl shoots a stream of lava at Sharkboy's backside. A girl freezes a character, who explodes into many snowflakes. Lavagirl is wrapped up in cables and shocked, a boy fights them with punches and kicks, then with a stick, and two cables surround the boy and zap him. Electric cords writhe like snakes, and Sharkboy and Lavagirl fight with several of them. Many creatures charge toward Sharkboy, Lavagirl and Max, and the children ride on a vehicle that shoots fudge at the creatures. None Sharkboy loses his dad in a tornado/storm at sea. There is a scene were Sharkboy goes legitimately insane by laughing bubbles. He screams as his sharp teeth shows up. Several scenes show Max having nightmares e.g.we see Max crying over Lavagirl (unconscious and soaked.) Sharkboy is zapped repeatedly by electric eels and sinks to the bottom motionless and Lavagirl dives into the eel infested water and pulls Shark Boy to the surface and then we see her straggling to breathe and falls unconscious. Mild sequences of harmless action throughout. Sharkboy calls Max ""a little bleep"". A character says, ""fudge."" Name-calling (hot head and dream-boy.)"

Dragon Wars: D-War	PG-13	1	1	1	1	1	The main female star wears a shirt with spaghetti straps and her nipple are prominently shown in several scenes. This film contains intense action and violence throughout. There are a few instances of blood when the evil dragon drops a dead elephant there are big bloody bite marks on it, also in the last half-hour when the dragons are shot by the army bloody bullet holes are pretty apperent. Girls drink at a bar. There are some intense scenes that may cause younger viewers to jump. Like: loud noises and possibly the looks of the dragons. 4 hells, 1 shit, and 1 damn.

I Know Who Killed Me	R	16	27	7	5	1	"A 21 year old girl has sex with her boyfriend while her mother listens. No nudity but humping and thrusting are clearly visible including a woman's bareback for a period of time. What's worse is that the mother doesn't do anything to stop the sex scene but the sex scene is very over the top. A stripper's breasts are shown in the first few minutes of the movie at an opening in a strip club. The nudity is shown breifly but mildy. First with her bra on and later on scenes with breasts visible. We see various bare-breasted women in a strip club where a woman does her pole dancing thing again. This time, she's even more scantly clad than before (a sheer bikini type top and small and tight shorts that show much of her bare butt) and she does various sexual moves, while also bending over, crawling on all fours, and lying on her back and spreading her legs for the patrons to see. At various points, the camera focuses close on her body parts. In biology class, a man is asked to find the female reproductive organs and the seminal receptor, but he ends up pointing out the male reproductive organs (for what turns out to be worms, which aren't seen). A teenage girl then jokingly tells him that it looks like he needs more experience with the female anatomy. The man puts his hand on her lap near the genitals. We see slow-motion views of a woman doing her striptease pole dance while scantly clad (in mini shorts that show a lot of her bare butt, almost like a thong, and a camisole type top that shows cleavage). We also see a bare-breasted woman in the same venue. Knowing a woman is checking him out, a worker removes his shirt outdoors and then suggestively holds a branch in front of him (in a somewhat phallic fashion), all as we see a close-up view of her clothed butt, representing his POV. We see a side autopsy view of a fully nude woman's dead body on a table (we see the bare breasts and part of the bare butt). Finding that one of her fingers has fallen off, a woman faints and ends up on the floor (in her revealing striptease outfit). A man rushes out to ask some male FBI agents if they have a condom or ""rubber,"" and they laugh that they don't, amused by his urgency (but this turns out to be just a diversion on his and Dakota's part). A high school man and woman is seen briefly but passionately kiss while clothed and standing. The two sleep with each other and a vision of light. We see a shirtless man with a large tattoo on his chest (that moves in an animated fashion). A cat has his genitals shown coming out of his butt. Note: it wasn't intended to be sexually but to the viewers look it is pretty disgusting. A young woman watches a man in her rear view mirror, he takes off his shirt and is bare-chested, she steps out of her car and looks at him, and she turns and walks away. A young man caresses a young woman's knee, she pushes him away, they talk about the fact that she does not want to have sex with him, and he professes his love for her. A young woman wears low-cut tops and dresses throughout the movie that reveal cleavage and bare shoulders. Young men are shown bare-chested in a few scenes, and a man removes his shirt and we see him bare-chested. A young man and a young woman (her chest is covered with a sheet and he's bare-chested) lie in bed talking, after having had sex. A young woman talks about selling her body to hairy old men with B.O. A young woman asks a young man if he ever had sex with another young woman. A young woman calls another young woman a sex addict. A young woman says that she is a hostess at a ""gentleman's club."" A young man is embarrassed when asked to identify the female sex organs of an earthworm and he mistakenly finds the male sex organs. A woman hears voices in her head and has a disturbing flashback including a briefly visible shower, two girls screaming, a severed digit and a hit in the head with a shovel and knows that she has to stop the killer. She gets out and sneaks through the porch. She goes to the basement and knocks a football plopping down the stairs. That alerts the killer so she hides in the corner hoping her won't see him. There's talk of limb amputation, and that the killer used amphetamines to keep his victim alert during his sadistic spree of amputating some of her limbs. We see a recreation of some people in a bar drinking. One is then shot in the neck and killed. At the same time, his twin in another location suddenly has blood flow from a new hole in his neck, as well as out of his mouth. We see some still photos of stigmata, including one man with blood down from both eyes. (also seen in the trailer of the movie). It is black and white. The killer digs up a young woman who is buried alive. The soil digs on the glass coffin transitioning into a flash of an owl. A teenage girl is kidnapped (not seen) and then seems in anguish while bound and gagged and having blurry views of her sadistic kidnapper. He then places a brick of dry ice onto her right hand, and we later see her fingers that are all black. He then lifts that ice that ends up pulling off some skin and meat from her hand (seen in closeup). He then uses a glass cleaver to cut off those fingers, with bloody results (including a stream running off from the scene), all as she screams and struggles in pain. After the torture, she tries grabbing on some tools with her left hand. Someone reaches through a doorway trying to grab a young woman, she pushes the door closed on the person's arm, and then begins sawing off the person's hand -- the camera lingers and it takes some time to separate while blood accumulates, and we see the blade slowly making its way through the skin and the bone; the hand plops to the floor and the person runs screaming with an exposed wrist stump. We see another view of the gloved hand going down the bloody striptease pole. We then see the woman remove that glove, with a finger falling out (we see blood on the severed digit as well as the hand). We later see a bloody towel around her hand, and then blood dripping onto the floor in a bus, with a stranger telling her she needs to get her hand above her heart to stop that. A young woman has what seems to be a nightmare about being cut and mutilated. In the nightmare, the killer wearing blue uses a glass blade to press on the woman's arm. In the hospital bed, we see a puncture wound opening in her arm, blood pools and dribbles and she wakes up and sees her arm covered with blood and she screams in panic. The blood she smears all over leaving a mess. Her father comes in the hospital room quickly A young woman tapes a severed finger onto a table, and then begins stitching it back to her hand with a needle and thread (we see the needle tugging against the skin and we hear her breathing and moaning and we see blood on the table and on the hand and finger). A young woman is bound and gagged and strapped to an operating table, someone puts a drug in her mouth, and she writhes and struggles against her restraints. -A young woman wakes up during surgery to amputate her arm and leg, she hyperventilates, and then goes back under and we hear the noise of the saw. A young woman wakes up with an amputated leg and a cast on her hand The killer wearing blue tries to stab a woman with a glass blade but she gets out and trips him. He lands on an electronic air conditioner with lightening flashing against him. The woman goes under an operating table and the man is stabbed in the gut and jabbed in the carotid artery (blood pours and spurts from his wounds), He takes one last stroll with his bloody shirt and he collapses to the floor with his mannequin legs. In another scene, we see a video of a man being shot and another man develops a similar wound that bleeds heavily. A man with a tire iron goes into a serial killers house to confront the killer and does not come out; a young woman goes looking for him and finds blood trickling down onto a blood bucket. She sees him wrapped in plastic mortally wounded on an operating table soaked with blood. He tells her his final words and died. We also see a severed hand in a bowl of ice with clothes and gloves on the floor. The man with the severed hand plays the piano and in the stair cellar there is a glass blade full of blood (implied it was used to torture someone else). A young woman falls off a chair and to the floor and we see her with a bloody nose to drip down her chin. A young woman has a dream about a young man taking off his shirt and revealing a tattoo of a heart with wings, and the wings begin to move, and then slashes appear across his chest (no blood is evident). We see parents of a young woman identifying her body in a morgue and they scream and cry in disbelief (we see her on the table covered with a sheet and her face is tinged blue). A young woman pounds on an apartment door, opens it, recoils from the smell and finds a woman dead in a chair (we see the woman's blue-tinged face and arms). She has been known to be dead of drug overdose and she is identified as a crackhead. (Flies are feeding from the corpse). A woman tries to get a trophy at a house. An image appears on the mirror of a tortured girl with a white dress and a killer holding a shovel smacking her in the face. Her twin also gets the identical motion falling on the carpet with blood on her nose dripping to her chin. The killer drags her, then an owl appears. Rose thorns of blue land on a stream. A killer kisses prosthetic legs that hang from a ceiling, and then caresses a young woman's hair with a sharp knife. He says that she should be dead by now. A young woman fights with someone who is trying to kill her, the killer grabs her arm (it is prosthetic), and he rips the prosthetic out and knocks her with the prosthetic arm. We hear a loud scream and a slashing sound while looking at a black screen. She gets tied up. A woman nearly crashes on a dog when she swerves to miss an animal in the road and discovers a badly injured (dismembered) person in a ditch on the side of the road (not much is visible in the dark) but she does comfort the woman. A stump of gore is seen on the woman's arm A man describes the wounds a young woman suffered while writing an autopsy report (limbs and digits had been removed). We hear that a young woman's body was found after she had been missing. A young woman argues with police on information about the person who kidnapped and tortured her. A young woman is frightened while walking alone on a dark road when she sees a figure watching her from a distance. We see someone closing a casket lid and digging a grave. Two young girls hold their hands as if they are injured and scream. A young woman has trouble breathing and feels like she is suffocating when she is having a panic attack in the car. A young woman separates from her friends, walks into a crowd looking for someone and does not return to a previously arranged meeting place. A possum eats something (we hear slurping and crunching), and a young woman pricks her finger on the thorn of a rose. Catching a teenage girl smoking in her room, a woman takes the cigarette and says it's a non-smoking house, but takes a drag before putting it out. We see cigarette butts in an ashtray. A young woman takes a pill and drinks from a bottle of alcohol. A man drinks alcohol in a few scenes, and people are shown smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol in several exotic dance club scenes. A young woman smokes cigarettes in several scenes, and a woman smokes cigarettes in several scenes. A young woman says that her mother died from a drug overdose and a young woman talks about being raised by a crack addict. Some underage smoking and alcohol use. A dismembered teenage girl is seen in the side of the road limbless. An operating room sequence occurs. Tissues of blood is everywhere. A woman has nightmares, the deaths are bloody. A woman finds a body on a table under a sheet of plastic. It appears dead, but the person is alive, albeit only for a moment (and may be lying in blood on the table). We hear the sound of a woman being tortured, followed by a loud thump (presumably a fatal blow). The movie has a dark and creepy setting into it. No kids should be allowed to see it. The torture scenes are very gross and tense to many viewers, seeing as how you see literally everything. The killer leaves the dry ice on the girl's hand and tears the skin apart. The killer cuts the hand and pours the blue liquid while the victim screams in pain. Bloody dismemberments involving limbs are seen overall. Fingers are cut off and falls. The extremities are torn off leaving bloody mess. (All the scenes are bloody) 18 ""f"" words (3 used sexually), 4 ""s"" words, 4 hells, 2 damns, 1 ass, 8 uses of ""Oh my God,"" 3 of ""Oh God,"" 2 of ""Jesus"" and 1 use each of ""G-damn"" and ""For God's sakes."""

Piranha 3DD	R	13	11	2	3	1	"Breasts,vulvas and buttocks are seen throughout (much less vulva than topless shots of women, bare breasts are the most frequent type nudity) For those reading that wish to make a distinction between the actor's actual genitals and prosthetic genitals, all male genitals in the movie are prosthetic (for special effects), not an actual penis. A young man and a young woman have sex: we see the young man thrusting, we see an outline of something squirm in her stomach, he makes a crude remark about climaxing and pulls back as the young woman appears to die (please see the Violence/Gore category for more details); a piranha is seen on the end of his genitals and we see his bare buttocks and prosthetic genitals as he chops the fish off. A woman's bare breasts are seen (covered in blood) as she holds a man's disembodied head in her hands and shakes it between her breasts. We see an ""adult pool"" where a fully nude woman (shaved genitals with visible labia are briefly but clearly visible) jumps into a pool while another topless woman is seen dancing suggestively against a pole and a fully nude woman is shown from underwater (her breasts are visible but genitals are obscured). A woman is seen facedown on a float (her bare buttocks are visible). A closeup of a woman's bare breasts and shaved crotch is seen as she steps out of a pool. We see many topless women, their bare breasts visible and multiple close-shots of women's bikini bottoms. We see a woman with bare breasts, and a nude man (his bare side is visible). We see shirtless young women in a pool (their bare breasts are visible) as they swim. We see in slow-motion young women shirtless (bare breasts are visible) in swimming pools. We see a young man's bare buttocks in a pool. A young man is seen thrusting in a pool of water, implied to be pleasuring himself on a water duct in the pool; he shouts in pleasure. A young woman tells a young man that he needs to ""make love"" to her, that she does not want to ""die a virgin"" and then makes a crude sexual remark; she takes off her pants and we see her underwear, focusing on her crotch. A young woman tells a young man that she wants to ""take off all their clothes"" and go swimming, the shadowy outline of their nude bodies is visible underwater. We see in slow-motion young women wearing bikinis walking slowly by and focusing on their buttocks. A man makes a crude remark about a young man ""boning"" a woman's stepdaughter. We see many people attacked by piranhas and men, women and children scream: we see blood covering many people, we see a piranha biting a young woman's neck and blood spouts from the wound, a man enters the water and shoots piranhas with a machine gun, and one shot hits a young man, knocking him backwards as pieces of exploding fish are seen in the water and blood fills a pool; we hear children screaming, a man rushes to help a shouting child, knocking a man over and pushing another man into the water, dead bodies are seen on the side of the pool and floating on top of the water, a man is seen missing an arm, a young man has the back half of a piranha literally sticking up his ass (headfirst, blood covers his buttocks) and another young man helps pull the piranha out of his ass as he screams (several of the above and definitely the last instance listed are played for comedy). A piranha appears to rip through a young woman's body: she seizes on a bed as a young man thrusts above her, engaged in active sex, we see blood spray as the young man pulls away from the young woman, a piranha is seen on his genitals, and the young man uses a large butcher knife to chop off his genitals (we see a spray of blood); the young woman wakes, blood is covering her and the room and she walks over to the fish, lying in a pool of blood, steps on it and it spits out the young man's genitals. This is extremely horrific and graphic. As a television reporter narrates, we see a short flashback of the ""Lake Victoria Massacre"" from the first movie. Blood fill the water of a crowded lake; young men and women struggle to climb onto a stage, leaving behind bloody handprints as some of them are dragged under the water; we see boats and swimming floats covered in blood and bloody people. A young man grabs the partially eaten body of a young woman from the water, we see blood and gore coming from her body, and she appears to have been decapitated; many bodies are seen covering the ground and floating in the water, including partially eaten bodies. We see the dead body of a young woman as a piranha snaps at her finger and swims away (the body appears covered in bite marks). A piranha leaps at two young women who angrily smash it to death causing blood to spray over them. A young woman is dragged out of the water and is unharmed except from a small bite on her ankle (we later see the cut look slightly gangrenous). A man has a flashback of himself using a boat motor to kill many piranhas; blood fills the water. A young woman swims in blood-filled water and we see disembodied limbs zoom past her, the young woman begs a young man for help and she goes underwater. Seconds before a young woman is attacked by a piranha, a young man throws a spear through its head. We see blood pooling in the water under a woman on a raft and seconds later she screams. Throughout the movie we frequently see young men and women smoking cigarettes, marijuana cigarettes, and drinking alcohol in excess. A police officer approaches a group of young men and women and he remarks that there should not be underage drinking as the officer smokes what appears to be a marijuana cigarette and drinks a beer. The piranha attacks could be quite intense and frightening to some young viewers, however, many are played for laughs, unlike the first film. The film is filled with graphic and overtly gory deaths, though there is more bodily mutilation than death. One small child is decapitated and his mother is seen screaming and crying (made more horrific by the fact that the film seems to portray this as an amusing thing). Some scenes may scare some young viewers, however there are a lot of comical scenes and this installment is less scary and less intense than the first film. About 23 fucks, 7 sexual references, 16 shits, 18 anatomical terms, 12 mild obscenities"

Ballistic: Ecks vs. Sever	R	1	1	1	1	1	"None. Despite the MPAA giving this film an R rating, there's not much violence that wouldn't be considered PG-13 and there's no blood at all except for the occasional scar by motorcycle accidents or knife use but even it's not graphic. The shoot-outs are pretty intense in nature, except for any graphic, bloody or brutal quality whatsoever. People get in martial arts battles and get hit in the neck but nothing graphic happens. Explosions are present seeming how it's an Action Thriller. Ecks drinks & smokes commonly Some intense action sequences 2 possible uses of ""F*cking"" (Though they are heard on a tape recorder and may be missed) Brief use of ""Sh*t"" and ""Bi*ch."" Besides that, nothing else that wouldn't be up to PG-13 level."

A prolongued scene of lesbian sex with full frontal nudity and brief anus views of the actress (7 minutes) Two teenage girls argue; the argument escalates with name-calling and accusations until they lunge at each other and fight briefly (we see them pulling each other's hair and yelling) until they are separated by others.

As a man is trapped in a cellar, the walls start oozing blood; a water pipe breaks and starts spewing blood all over the man.

Drugs, recreational: None Some characters smoke and drink wine. Although alot of the effects are dated, The Evil Dead is still EXTREMELY bloody and graphic. Although very gory, the film has a lot of black comedy and it is also unintentionally funny sometimes Some uses of ""Shit"" No f words"

A woman's buttocks was shown and a man walks up to her and fingers roughly Early in the movie, the lead actress is working at a Las Vegas strip club, so we see several fully-nude women, though most of the dancers are topless and wearing very skimpy thongs. In one of these scenes, a fully-nude stripper is crawling erotically on all fours across the stage, away from the camera, exposing her shadowed vulva to the camera. In most other scenes, shadows, trimmed pubic hair, or careful camera work conceal the woman's genitalia when we see full frontal nudity. There are occasional brief flashes of labia in these scenes, but they're easy to miss. (Deleted. Personal opinions about content are not appropriate for the Parents Guide.) A woman gives a man a lap dance, during which she strips completely nude. At the climax of the dance, she vigorously dry humps him. It is implied that he has an orgasm.

They begin to kiss erotically, and he pulls her top down, exposing her bared breasts with erect nipples. When he puts his hand down her pants, she warns him off, claiming her period. He doubts it, so she invites him to check. He pushes his hand deeper, then withdraws his hand and rubs his fingers together ruefully, realizing that she wasn't lying.

Pink Flamingos	NC-17	5	5	5	3	1	"Women are kept chained up nude in a basement and said to have been raped. One unconscious woman is artificially inseminated. A man lures a woman into his bedroom, and has sex with her, however this sex turns into rape once he begins to have sex with a chicken as well.

Extended views of her breasts and his buttocks, a fleeting view of his erection and scrotum.

It is partially crushed and muffled squawking is heard. (The chicken was actually killed in this scene, and some blood is seen.) A few cops are killed mostly offscreen (no sounds are heard due to background music). Their bodies are then hacked up and eaten. Organs (excluding the intestines) and other body parts are seen, but they look a bit unrealistic. Two people are killed by a gunshot to the head or face offscreen. No sounds are heard, but their bloody faces are seen afterwards. Semen is supposedly injected into a vagina via a syringe. Scene is in close-up, lasting for a few seconds. Frequent drug use throughout Some hard drug use Mild smoking. In one scene, a group of people all take illegal drugs. It is said that the Marbles sell drugs to elementary school students.

This film is very shocking and disturbing Ending is very shocking Semi-frequent uses of 'fuck' and 'asshole', several of 'bitch' (used in anger towards unsavory characters), a few of 'cunt' (in the deleted scenes), and 1 of 'whore'."

Lust, Caution	NC-17	4	7	1	2	1	"A man and woman are shown having sex twice, the man's buttocks are visible on the first scene. A man forcefully takes off a woman's clothes and has rough sex with her. Her butt is shown and the scene is bordering on S&M. A woman wakes up, takes off the sheet of the bed, and walks to the window. She is fully nude; her breasts and butt are shown, and her pubic region is briefly visible when she walks by a mirror. There are several sex scenes with a man and woman where they are in several positions with a lot of moaning and thrusting. The woman's breasts, butt, and pubic region are shown in most of these. The man's butt is shown, and once a brief view of his genital. These sex scenes last a while. A man pulls a gun and fires in the air, another man has a knife, and a couple of men then hold one man down, while another man stabs him slowly in the abdomen (we see blood ooze from the wound); the victim pulls the knife out and tries to use it on his attacker, who gets the knife back and stabs him again, repeatedly, he stumbles toward the door (we see blood on his hands and the floor), and someone else stabs him in the back several times, whereupon he falls down a flight of stairs, tries to get up and someone grabs his head and twists it breaking his neck (we hear a crunch). There is a rape scene with a married man and a young woman, who start out in a secluded room, presumably planning to have consensual sex: The man grabs the young woman, throws her against a wall, tears off her underwear, throws her onto a bed, removes his belt and strikes her with it several times, then ties her hands with the belt, removes his pants, climbs on top of her and thrusts; she moans in pain and pulls her hair (we see her lying on the bed afterward in the fetal position, with torn clothing and he leaves her there). Several people are grabbed violently, struck with clubs and forced to kneel on the ground at the edge of a deep quarry; some have bloody facial wounds from beatings and they are all shot one-by-one (we do not see the shootings or the aftermath). We see two dead bodies on a street (one has a bullet hole in the head with blood on the wound and pooled on the street). Two men collect dead bodies from the street (people who have died from starvation and exposure) and put them in a pile on a cart (we see grey-tinged skin and stained teeth). A man playing a soldier on stage wears a blood stained bandage on his leg. A man kicks another man in the head. Soldiers with guns shove people to their knees and rough them up.
Several people with guns prepare and hide as someone approaches an apartment door (nothing happens). People load guns and prepare for an attack. People with guns take target practice. A man runs out of a jewelry shop and dives into a car fearing an assassination attempt. A woman talks about a man ""hurting her until she bleeds so that he feels alive."" A man caresses a young woman's thigh and presses his hand between her legs while describing acts of violence: he talks about a man's brains being ""out"" and another man spilling his blood on him. A man talks about a man having killed his wife and children and that he seeks to avenge himself. We hear that members of a resistance cell were arrested and interrogated. We hear that a young man's brother died in the war. People talk about killing a traitor. Most if not all main characters smoke cigarettes. Every sex scene and rape scenes are graphic, disturbing, and brutal. There is a scene where a group military execution is carried out. Uses of Whore, Bastard, and Hell and one use of fuck"

Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!	NC-17	4	4	3	1	1	"In a scene in a bathtub, there is female full frontal nudity including pubic hair.

In another scene, a man is seen watching a sex tape of a woman masturbating alone; nudity includes bare breasts and partial view of hip/buttock. In one scene, as a woman changes clothing, she is shown completely naked from behind. As she partially turns, her breast is visible. In several other scenes, she is shown topless. Naked man and woman have intercourse on top of a bed. They change sexual positions. Thrusting and panting is shown. Explicit moaning. This is a very long scene. Nudity includes bare chest, male full rear nudity and bare breasts, though the majority of the shots are from the shoulders up. In the back of a pharmacy, a man is seen on top of woman having intercourse, both partly undressed. Nudity includes only bare-chested male. A man forces his way into a woman's apartment when she tries to close the door on him. During the ensuing struggle he knocks her out with a head-butt when she screams. A woman throws a glass at a man's face, cutting him. He grabs her and subdues her physically. Although she expresses a suspicion that he will rape her, he never does so. A man holds a woman at gunpoint, and later ties her to a bed, but does not physically harm her. A man is beaten in a street fight, he is shown cut and slightly bloody. At one point he is knocked out. The lead female character is a recovering drug addict. There are several scenes where this is discussed. There is movie cast party where drinking is occurring.
Several characters are shown as being drunk. The male character goes to buy drugs from a drug dealer. The initial attack scene can be disturbing to some, since we do not yet know the attacker's true intentions - particularly when he head-butts her to knock her out. A handful of F words as well as a scattering of other profanity throughout the movie."

Bad Lieutenant	NC-17	5	3	5	3	5	"Two women are on a bed on their knees one is behind another and blindfolds/gags her, and thrusts from behind. She's completely nude, while the one behind is clothed.

The film later implies that she was raped with a crucifix. Woman's nude body is shown during a doctor's examination showing her breasts and pubic hair. Later, a girl shows him her buttocks (she's wearing a thong) as her sister mimes oral sex while he masturbates. A man fires a gun in a convenience store. It almost hits two men but ends up hitting glass bottles on a shelf behind them. This is sudden and intense. There is violent content and themes throughout, but there are only actually one or two scenes of violence The film has very violent themes and dialogue, however the only violence is a scene of rape and a murder scene with two victims seen close up. A man and woman inject heroin A man and woman smoke heroin A man smokes crack cocaine A man smoked methamphetamine Nearly non-stop graphic drug and alcohol content including the sale and use of crack, cocaine, heroin, tobacco and hard liquor on screen and references to marijuana use. A very, very depressing movie. LT's actions may prove very disturbing to some. A man breaks down in a church and hallucinates Jesus standing in front of him.

Very strong and non-stop language throughout. Every foul word imaginable is used. 83 uses of fuck."

Orgazmo	NC-17	5	1	1	2	1	There is constant sexual innuendo and humor portrayed in a way so lighthearted it's almost downright innocent. There are many scenes on porn movie sets, with directions given to the actors, and many, many scantily clad women and men (several men's bare buttocks are seen, and a woman's breasts are partially shown for less than a split second). Men and women are shown fooling around in several scenes, though nothing graphic is shown. Lots and lots of vagina-shaped objects are shown throughout the movie and one character wears a dildo on his head in several scenes. One of the characters in the film invents a handheld ray gun which, when shot at people, causes them to instantly orgasm. He and his friend use this on themselves to give themselves (clothed) orgasms, and we see and hear their pleasured responses. The two of them walk around town, using this orgasm gun on unsuspecting townsfolk, including pretty girls, some rabbis, and an old lady. All of these people are seen orgasming in comical ways. A man shoots a dog with the orgazmo gun and the dog (a German Shepherd) runs over to him and starts humping him the man tries to crawl away but the dog keeps on going, later on the man rings on a door and when it is opened the dog is still there humping the man's leg. (The dogs genitals are visible while he is humping). Comic fighting and explosions. Nothing graphic or unsettling. Some smoking and drinking throughout the movie. MA15+ ( Strong Sexual References & Coarse Language ) None. Frequent profanity. 57 of 'Fucks', crude sexual slang, and generally graphic language throughout.

A Dirty Shame	NC-17	8	3	1	1	2	A woman is shown fully nude while talking to her neighbor. Her husband, fully nude, joins her, and they both talk to the neighbor. Nipples and vagina are visible on the woman, and the male's penis is visible. Multiple types of alternate sexual experiences are explored, including sexual pleasure by pouring food on the body, acting like a baby, licking dirt, homosexual cuddling, sexual pleasure by levitating, pleasure by smacking one's head against another person's head, pleasure from pooping and leaving it in random places, pleasure by publicly rubbing your genitals against someone else, and pleasure by oral sex. Between three and five non-explicit but nonetheless graphic uses of oral sex. No nudity is shown. Two men are seen naked, their penis' visible. A woman picks up a bottle with her vagina, fully visible. A woman with breasts the size of watermelons strips topless and starts dancing. Both nipples are visible. Two squirrels have sex together and fall through a ceiling. Non-graphic, though we do see thrusting. A snake bursts out of a man's crotch as a joke. Characters change from being excessively prudish to completely uninhibited when they receive concussions on their heads. All of these scenes are lighthearted and comedic. We see many ways the concussions happen through a variety of accidents. No one suffers serious injury. A squirrel is run over by a car (offscreen), but it is resuscitated. Several people smack their heads against each other's to get sexual pleasure. A man swallows a cup filled with prozac pills. The scene where a squirrel is run over might disturb some more sensitive viewers. The theatrical, NC-17 rated version uses occasional but not frequent profanity. The entire film centers on various alternative sexual experiences, some that are creative such as ta-tas instead of tits or funnin' instead of fuckin'. Sure older teens and adults will understand what they mean; but the alternative words will go over most kids heads therefore not making it too extreme when it comes to profanity.

In one he is partly obscured by the camera angle. Other scenes involve nudity and sexual contact as well. In one, he moves his hand up a woman's nickers.

Some of the 'punishment' scenes, particularly those involving painful whipping, may be hard for some to stomach.

After a few minutes, he stand and urinates on the pornography and in this scene, a closeup of his penis is shown as he urinates. In a bar scene, men sing about what their limbs do while they dance. When it comes to what happens to the penis, one man pulls down his pants and flips his penis and scrotum up and down twice using his fingers. But the scene comes and goes quickly before your realize what's happening. The boy lead goes to a beach. Three men come and sit near by and they strip naked. The genitals of one man are shown relatively close up and he has metal rings through his penis and scrotum. The boy then takes off his towel revealing that he is nude and his penis and scrotum are clearly shown. The boys actions imply that he is willing to join the men sexually but the boys mother shows up and the two talk.

Female Trouble	NC-17	5	7	1	1	2	"Pervasive and frequent crude sexual humor throughout the film. A sleazy older man picks up a teenage girl (played by an adult male) and takes her to a garbage dump where they have sex on a filthy mattress. He subsequently performs oral sex on her, as over-the-top sucking noises can be heard while the girl repeatedly tells him to ""eat it"". Traces of faeces are visible on the man's underwear. Both characters are played by Divine (which is why you do not see the two characters' faces in the same shot), and in a later scene, the man tells the woman to go ""fuck [herself]"" as a callback to the sex scene. There is no nudity in this scene. A brief but explicit scene of a naked woman bouncing on a naked man's face. Contains some genital detail. Two closeup shots of penises. A woman is shown fondling her breasts while looking at herself in a mirror. Several grown men make sexual propositions to a 14-year-old girl (she is, however, played by a 26-year-old actress). Brief, satirical references to child abuse: a mother attempts to beat her child with a car aerial and then chains her to her bed with the assistance of two friends. A woman on a stage fires a gun into the audience, killing one man. A riot ensues and police kill one man with a shotgun, resulting in a bloody face wound. A woman throws acid into another characters face, resulting in bloody burns and later, grotesque disfigurement. A woman is locked in a giant birdcage and later has her hand chopped off. Her bloody stump of a wrist is seen. A man is (unrealistically) stabbed to death with a kitchen knife, with bloody results. A riot results in several deaths. A woman is electrocuted in the electric chair onscreen. All violence in the film is deliberately over-the-top and so unrealistic that they cannot be taken seriously. A woman takes a recreational intravenous injection (of liquid eyeliner) in her arm in order to get high and ""heighten one's beauty awareness"". Although all horror scenes are played for laughs, they are still relatively graphic. Contains frequent strong coarse language (i.e. fuck). Also contains some use of milder terms (e.g. shit, asshole, god damn etc.)."

Law of Desire	NC-17	4	6	1	0	2	On a film set, a man takes off his clothes, kisses himself in a mirror, rubs up against it. We see his buttocks, and he starts to feel himself on the direction of the voice-over. We see him masturbating from behind until orgasm. A man tries to take pictures up a woman's dress. Two men make out and kiss on a bed, we only see their chests and buttocks. They prepare to have penetrative sex, but we do not see much as one turns off the light and the scene ends.

Two men snort coke in a cubicle.  A few swear words. One use of m*ricón/queer.

Inside Deep Throat	NC-17	1	1	1	1	1	"Both versions feature graphic sex scenes and full frontal male and female nudity. However, The NC-17 edition has an extra scene that lasts 30 seconds of real deep throat fellatio. The movie refers strongly to the movie ""Deep Throat"" Hence the title ""Inside deep Throat"" none Some smoking in the historic films. none A few F bombs here and there. The ""C word"" Is once used sexually"

Bent	NC-17	6	4	1	1	1	The film's sexual content is not very explicit. A man is seen front and back getting out of bed, urinating, and fleeing from SS officers. The performers at a cabaret dance suggestively, some of the women in see-through costumes. There is an orgy sequence which includes simulated sex with both same and opposite sex pairings. Men are shown being disinfected with white powder and showering it off; they keep their crotches covered with their hands. Two clothed men talk themselves to orgasms while standing perfectly still without touching themselves or each other. A man confesses to necrophilia, having raped a dead 13-year old girl to prove that he was not gay and performing oral sex on a guard for favors. A man's throat is cut.

A man who is probably dead is thrown from a moving train. A man is shot to death. A man electrocutes himself. Other beatings and similar indignities consistent with life in a concentration camp are shown. Cigarettes and alcohol show up quite frequently in the first quarter of the film. Cocaine is used once and spoken of once more later on in the film. The scenes on the transport train are pretty horrific. Some may be stunned by the other death scenes as well. Very little. The F-word is used a six times, both as an expletive and in its literal meaning. The S-word is used twice.

Swearnet: The Movie	NC	9	7	3	0	2	"A woman hangs out of a window topless, bare breasts are seen. A nude woman gets up after getting a massage, partial breasts and buttocks are seen.

Mike has to perform a homosexual sex act on an elderly race offical to get their car back into the race after telling him he would ""do anything"" for Robb and JP. A graphic video of the sex act is shown later in the movie, where Mike gives the race official a handjob, resulting in (off screen) ejaculation.

The film's title is no surprise that there is going to be swearing in it. and this film is full of it. Words included are fuck, shit, asshole, cunt, cock, son of a bitch, ass, jizz, bitch and many more. Most swears and thrown together for comical effect. A record 935 f-bombs."

Hard to Die	NC-17	2	13	0	1	1	Many, many scenes and sequences of women taking off their shirts or bras or walking around without a top Several woman are seen nude in the shower for several minutes Many characters are murdered, but nothing is shown very graphically (SOME spoilers here : ) A woman is pulled behind some crates and slashed with a hook- all we see is a crate splashed with blood A woman is grabbed and slashed with a hook- all we see is the shadow of the hook on the wall, then blood splatters on it Two bloody dead bodies are discovered in a crate A man is stabbed, bludgeoned, and machine-gunned many times over the course of the movie, he bleeds a lot... but never dies A woman is viciously choked, then her neck is snapped A woman is set on fire, her charred dead body is later discovered An unconscious woman is thrown down an elevator shaft A man is machine-gunned to death and bleeds A woman is machine-gunned to death and falls down dead A man is shot in the leg and falls down A woman is machine-gunned over and over again and bleeds, but doesn't die A man is knocked off the roof of a very tall building  The movie has a dark, creepy tone to it. But most viewers will probably find it laughable. Very little cursing- if any

Wide Sargasso Sea	NC-17	1	3	1	2	1	Explicit sexual content. We see bodies fully naked, both male and female, and full-length images of men and women having sex, both with clothes and without. No actual sex or really prolonged scenes are shown. A dead horse, killed by rebel slaves, is shown briefly. A house catches fire and a bird, still alive, is shown briefly flying while on fire. A man and a woman have a struggle and he attempts (and fails) to dominate her in sex. A fair amount of both, as was common in historical upper classes. Some people are hurt during a house raid, in which rebel island locals set the house on fire and the family is forced to flee. One child ends up dead. Two women who have lost their sanity are shown. They are not very violent, but clearly mad. Mild

100 Tears	NC-17	2	14	2	1	1	The movie's plot is Gurdy gets revenge on those who unjustly condemned him after being accused of rape There is one scene that shows a man performing a sexual act with a woman in an alley. They are also seen briefly kissing. Because the movie is a comedic horror film, the violence is intentionally over the top, fake looking, and played for laughs. Extreme graphic violence and gore throughout, including decapitations, disembowelings, and bisections via an oversized meat cleaver. Please note that the gore is wayyyy over the top (and somewhat intended to be comical). A man slaughters an entire house : he chops ones face to ribbons, chops a man's head in half vertically, decapitates two, slashes one's back, stomps one one's head, chops at a woman's stomach which causes her intestines to gush out, chops a man from his crotch up (we see blood splatter) and breaks one's neck. We see a woman with her feet cut off. A man has a circular saw taken to his stomach and he then is decapitated. A man has part of his face chopped at, his feet cut off and his arms cut off. A man is chopped in half horizontally. In a flashback we see a man who has his head impaled on a stick. We see a woman with half her face skinned off.

A man has his throat slit. A man has half has head chopped off. A woman is bludgeoned by a car. A clown is shot to death. Moments later we see the body. No blood or gore is involved. At the end of the movie we see a woman driving a car covered in blood. A circus performer drinks in his home. We see a man working at a restaurant smoking. Frightening/intense scenes throughout, including a homicidal circus clown, dark warehouse, and scenes of extreme violence and gore. F**k and Sh*t are used many times throughout the movie including many more swears and terms that some could be offended by.

Lucky Bastard	NC-17	3	7	1	0	3	"The film deals with the filming of pornography. The beginning scene is ""rape porn"" where two women (porn stars) act like they are raped by a man. Throughout the rest of the film, there is a lot of discussion of pornography, including oral and anal sex. During the sex scenes, breasts, butts (male and female), female pubic regions, and penises are visible. Though blurred out, a man is shown masturbating. The sex scenes include oral sex (both males going down on females and females going down on males), breasts bouncing, and lots of groping. A woman is shown fully nude in the shower, breasts and pubic region visible. A man pranks her by using a dildo and recreating the shower scene from ""Psycho"". The intro is of a crime scene investigation where some bodies are shown throughout a property, some of which have blood from bullet wounds. The fake rape scenes in the beginning of the film are fairly violent, though they are acting. A man takes a stone and bludgeons a man to death. Lots of blood and skull-crunching noises heard. A woman enters a room and a man hits her over the head with a baseball bat. She is shown falling down but no blood. A few people are shot. A man pulls down another man's pants and then rams a dildo up his rectum. A man hits another man over the head with a pistol. Some cigarette smoking.  Constant swearing, mostly the ""f"" word.

Inserts	NC-17	9	7	3	1	2	Extended full-frontal male nudity, topless male nudity; a man's erect penis is shown, pubic hair. Strong graphic sexual dialog throughout. In a cinema, people watch a pornographic film. A man sits on a bed wearing only an ascot next to a woman in a nightgown. She points and laughs at his penis, and he takes his ascot off and strangles her with it. He then tears her nightgown off, and rapes her. He also squeezes her breast to a humorous honking sound. This is simulated, but you see his buttocks and possibly his penis, her breasts, and very briefly, her pubic hair. The film concerns the making of this porno. A woman lies down in a nightgown, and we can very possibly see her labia through the bottom. A man tries to convince another man to commit necrophilia, but fails. A man tells a woman to take her blouse off. She complies, revealing a see-through teddy. They retreat to the bed for more filming. He pulls her teddy off, revealing her breasts. She remains topless for the rest of the film (over 40 minutes). For filming, a man fondles, and licks the woman's breasts and nipples. This scene is extremely erotic and sensual. After this, the woman pretends to be raped, but nobody is having sex with her for real. The woman reveals her vagina as part of the film. We see this from behind. The woman unsuccessfully tries to seduce the impotent man, before finally noting he has an erection at the sight of her naked body. He pulls down his pants, and he climbs on top of her body. He moves down and bites her leg sexually, then crawls back up. He then thrusts into her, and they both orgasm. This scene is also extremely erotic and sensual. During all of these scenes past the above spoiler warning, we only see the woman's breasts. In a film being screened within the film, a woman is strangled with an ascot and is raped. (See Sex & Nudity). A woman injects herself with heroin. A woman is pushed off a sofa. While filming a movie, woman is brutally strangled with an ascot again, before being punched repeatedly while being raped. The woman is unaware that the rape is actually violent. (See Sex & Nudity) A man's head is hit with a bottle. A woman's leg is bitten in a sexual manner. We later see the bite mark. Two men have a fight. It is broken up when another man hits one man in the head with another bottle. Alcohol: One character drinks to excess throughout the film. Drugs: explicit drugs use Smoking: Frequent cigarette smoking The rape scene is extremely graphic and disturbing. Strong, crude, graphic, and sexual dialog throughout. Several uses of strong profanity (e.g. fuck, cunt) in crude sexual contexts. There is also use of moderate profanity (e.g. shit, tits).

Home Alone 3	PG	8	27	1	1	1	"Molly mentions Alex slamming the toilet seat on his 'thing' which means his penis. A man gets hit in the crotch with a crowbar and says 'You smacked my winkie'. As Alice bends over, the back of her pants rip, exposing her red underwear. A man is seen with his trousers down. Alex is seen peeling stickers off of a poster with a topless woman. Very little is shown, but Stan's parrot says 'If those are real I'm an eagle'. Alex is seen taking his trousers down to inspect his rear end in the mirror, but only his lower legs and upper body are ever shown. Karen says that Alex's body is covered in chicken pox spots, to which Molly asks 'Would that include his buttock region?' Mr Pruitt is seen without his trousers. It takes him some time to realise. At the end we see a small amount of red in a mans crotch area from getting hit with a crowbar. It is not overly graphic Mainly played for laughs: a remote control car smacks someone in the face A man is hit by a car and lands on the windshield, men run into each other, a woman is dragged by a dog through some bushes A man falls several stories through the house landing on some planks then on a toilet. The toilet crushes down causing water the leak, others fall through the porch (after wooden planks hit them on the head), and Alice falls several stories down a dumbwaiter and we hear a crash. (All slapstick no harm done) A large book-filled chest falls from an attic window and lands on two of the men. Moments later, a barbell with weights then hits the two on their heads. A woman gets her hand stuck on goo in a trap and that removes her glove. She climbs over the fence and lands on tar. She gets stuck and trips on a string. A flower pot from the third story falls on her head a couple times. A man trips on a welcome mat under which there are marbles and he hits his nose on the knocking horseshoe.

A woman tries holding on the rails of the stair but it breaks apart. She falls her back on the stairs crushing her back. She tries doing another se of gymnastics and sucessfully lands on the porch but the planks have no stableness causing her to fall down to the closet. A man goes to a porch and the planks tilt hitting his head and making him fall into a closet landing on a woman. An intruder who is from the window steps on muddy glue in a cart. He starts rolling over uncontrollably and bumps into some objects. He enters the basement and the wheels trip on a bump making him do a handstand. He goes down the stairs and gets his hand caught on a mousetrap causing him to shoot the pipes. The pipes lead to the toile causing the toilet to unclog onto the man. The waste goes on the man's face (disgusting). An intruder tries getting in the window but a kid with a handlebar attached to a plastic bag full of snow hits the intruder's face. His face is covered with snow and the man gets a deflated balloon out of his tongue. A man finds a doll that looks like a kid who he wants to kidnap. He pulls and pulls making him activate a mower. He actually pulls a doll and the mower activates causing it to fall from the hole onto the man's head. (In real life this would've caused a gory impact) but due to the PG rating he actually gets his head shaved. A kid screws a nail on the front door and the man tries breaking in but the nail hits his hand. He reacts with ""OW"" four times. A man hears a kid crying (it is actually a doll) and gets trapped when he opens a door causing a boxing glove to hit his crotch. He falls down and all his ammo explodes onto his butt. The kid reacts with facial expression. A man and a woman tries charging at a kid but two of them charge at him at the same time causing them to fall. The man tries getting through, the kid closes the door making him bump his head. A man and woman tries getting a kid. They figure to use the trampoline to land so they both jump from the attic to the trampoline. The trampoline was on top of a pool of ice which causes it to break apart and for them to shiver in cold.

He tries stopping the sprinkler pulling harder but that just causes the sprinkler to spray on his scrotum. A man hides in an igloo. A parrot comes in and lites a bunch of fireworks. The fireworks blast him out. A woman kidnaps a dog. The kid tries using a dog whistle to rescue the dog. The dog starts running and that ties the woman's' legs dragging her to a bunch of bushes. At the end the woman stands up and her pants rip apart exposing her underwear (played for laughs). ALOT MORE FUNNY AND MORE BOOBY TRAPS THAT ARE GENIUS THAN 1ST HOME ALONE MOVIE! Like the 1st and 2nd movie there is slapstick violence: Alice whacks a man in the crotch with a stick when she sees Alex's pet rat poking its head out from the man's torn clothing. A woman falls a couple stories through the floors of a house. A woman binds and gags an elderly woman with duct tape and leaves the garage door open. Two men are electrically shocked, one by a chair rigged to a car battery, the other by grabbing electrified wires.

Like the first Home Alone there is slapstick violence but it's a little more harsh in this one: Harry, one of the bad guys, flies out and falls on a car and shatters the window. Marv, the other bad guy, gets electrocuted by the sink when Kevin hooks a generator to it. Both bad guys get bricks thrown at them but Marv ends up being the only one to get hit. The bad guys get other traps done on them. Staple gun, paint cans, tool chests, tools etc. Harry and Marv point a gun at Kevin, The bird lady throws bird seeds at them and they eat on them and yell. The birds eating on them is the funny part of this scene. Kevin watches a movie in which a character is seen smoking. Brief smoking is seen by two women in the park. Some may be a bit disturbed at the level of violence towards and given by children with the two bandits, despite most of them being played for laughs. Marv is seen being electrocuted, switching between human view, and skeletoral view. Much more violent than the first one. A few scenes involving the Twin Towers which may prompt questions from viewers born after 9/11. Kevin can be seen wandering alone in New York, Central Park at night with scary people bullying him and the taxi driver even scaring him. Buzz says 'Enough of this gooey sh...', before hastily changing tack and finishing with 'show of emotion'. One use of dammit, a few abuses of God's name. One use of 'big horse's ass'. One use of 'You little sh...', but it gets cut off."

Fantastic Mr. Fox	PG	2	4	1	2	1	"In one scene Mr.Fox and Mrs.Fox kiss briefly. Some innuendo, nothing to strong, Farmers use guns frequently, but there is no blood. Comical fighting is shown. There are two scenes in which characters claw at other characters, leaving deep scratches, but no blood. Animals are electrocuted by an electric fence, but no one is hurt. Mr. Fox kills chickens with his teeth. There is a reference to how grisly and bloody the process is, but it is an over-exaggeration and meant for humorous purposes, complete with comical discretion shots. Franklin Bean is seen smoking a cigarette every time he appears. Bean also keeps a cellar full of hard apple cider, very alcoholic, which Mr. Fox steals along with Boggis and Bunce's chickens. The animals also drink the alcoholic cider. On one occasion, Mr. Fox is seen smoking a tobacco pipe. Mrs. Bean brandishes a knife when two children foxes are in the kitchen. May make some feel intense The fight between Mr. Fox and Rat inside an electric generator room underground may be considered intense or scary for younger viewers. Most of the scene is in darkness, but brief moments of their fight are lit up by the crackling electricity. (Violent sounds may be heard.) Instead of using profanity, characters say sentences that would contain a swear word (especially the F word), but the word is replaced by the word ""cuss"" as a running joke. Some examples include ""You scared the cuss out of us,"" ""Don't you cuss with me,"" ""What the cuss,"" and ""cluster cuss."""

Jumanji	PG	1	3	2	12	1	Kissing scene In one scene Peter rolls the dice and summons a lion. It's tail wags across a piano playing a brief note of creepy music.

When the kids use the board game, the animals come out and some of their appearances are quite freaky. When the game starts near the beginning of the movie, young Alan is slowly sucked into the game (using CGI, of course). The appearance of him screaming and slithering into the game is quite frightening, and scary music plays at the same time. Right after this, young Sarah screams and runs out of the house in terror as dozens of bats begin chirping loudly and emerge from the fireplace. Alan drives a police car through a grocery store, destroying it in the process. Eventually, an entire shelf of paint cans falls on Van Pelt (this is played for comedic effect).

Snape's leg is pretty bloody in one scene Harry is verbally abused by his relatives a few times. Neville falls from an airborne broomstick and breaks his wrist.

It is revealed that if anyone brought to life by the tablet is outside the museum when the sun rises, they will turn into dust. In one scene, this happens to a caveman, and the dust falls straight down before a street sweeper cleans it up. A tyrannosaurus comes to life, and it appears at first to be trying to eat the main character (he only wants to play fetch). A wax human attempts to tear a mans limbs off which might scare younger viewers. The whole prospect of wax humans and statues coming to life might scare younger viewers. A scene where Larry locks up the lions might scare younger viewers. (They're not actually attacking him. They're just standing there rawring and acting like pet cats and dogs; even the male was standing at the locked gate acting like a dog whining when a person locks the door; however, Larry is earlier given a list of instructions saying ""lock up the lions or they'll eat you."") Probably a few dammits but basically none"

One corpse loses his head and another his arm during the scuffle. We see various ghosts, one of whom fires a pistol while another fires a crossbow where the arrow lands in another ghost's forehead rather than the apple on top of it (being a ghost, he's no worse for the wear).

The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe	PG	0	3	1	2	1	" The movie begins by dramatizing a depiction of the German attack. We see a plane crash in flames. Bombers loom overhead and loud explosions roar in the background as the children run for cover. Edmund and Peter are knocked over by the force of one blast. In between those ""modern"" and ""ancient"" battles, Peter, Susan, Lucy and the Beavers are pursued through a tunnel by a pack of wolves, who at another time catch the fox and threaten to kill him. The children also cross a frozen river as the ice breaks beneath their feet and as a frozen waterfall begins to thaw and collapse above them. They are eventually cornered by the wolves, and they wind up falling into the raging torrent and being swept downstream. Later, Peter kills a wolf with his sword. (Again, no blood is seen, even though Aslan tells Peter to clean his blade.) Some of Aslan's soldiers attack the White Witch's encampment to free Edmund, swinging swords as the Witch's henchmen fight back. Ginarrbrik, the White Witch's evil dwarf, tackles Edmund and holds a knife to his throat. The Witch slaps Edmund, and Ginarrbrik raps him over the head with a pike. Characters grimace in pain as the White Witch turns them to stone. The professor smokes a pipe. A wolf very suddenly pounces on Edmund. Later a wolf barks/growls at Susan when she pulls a towel away revealing him, startling her. The ending is quite sad, yet uplifting. None."

None Jess thinks he sees the dark master running through the woods, and the figure dives at him, but it turns out to be his dad. Overall, a family film. There are scenes of bullying. Large sharp-toothed creatures (they look like wild dogs) surround a boy and a girl, and they lunge at them: the boy and the girl fight them off with sticks, a dog bites the tail of one creature, and the boy imagines having an iron glove on his hand and punches two of the creatures that are thrown into a tree. A boy sees a dark, shadowy figure moving close to him through a forest and he is frightened. Says ""damn"" like 7 times in a conversation between Jesse and his father."

National Treasure	PG	5	3	1	4	3	"Ben and Abigail are seen changing clothes behind changing room doors. Abigail is obviously nude but her body is obscured by the door. The conversation they have can be seen as suggestive as Ben describes that his father believes that Ben has been ""cavalier."" Ben and Abigail arrive at his father's house to which Ben tells his Dad, ""I'm in trouble."" to which Ben's dad says, referring to Abigail, ""Is she pregnant?"" (She isn't, but she later asks why Ben's dad assumed THAT.) Main female character wears a dress through much of the movie that shows a good amount of cleavage. No Sex shown, No Nudity, references Only. As Abigail is typing the access code to a room, her co worker is seen standing behind her admiring her figure as she is wearing a pencil skirt and heels. Later Abigail and other women wear evening gowns. A flare falls on gunpowder causing a giant fiery explosion. Two partially decomposed bodies and a skeleton are seen. A rickety catwalk gives way, causing a man to fall into a seemingly bottomless abyss. Ian and his men unleash frequent flurries of gunfire and threaten peoples lives, but there are no casualties. A lit flare ignites a mans sleeve. Goons temporarily disable a guard by shooting him with a taser. Ben draws blood by pricking his thumb with a knife, and later knocks a pursuer out cold. And what would a Jerry Bruckheimer-produced movie be without wild chases, explosions and cars bashing through barriers? A bunch of gunfire erupts in a cemetery, although nobody is hit, several graves are desecrated A scene at a ""gala"" shows people drinking wine and champagne. Also, during a scene in which Ian and his men are deciphering the riddle, Shaw is briefly shown drinking a beer. One of the clues is involved using a pipe. Ian repeatedly threatens people with a gun. A lit flare causes gunpowder to ignite, and a ship explodes with two men inside it, but they save themselves by going into the ship's cargo hold. Numerous scenes may be very intense and/or frightening for some people because of all the action and violence. In a car chase, a woman is being held hostage and to save herself and her item, she hangs on to the back door of a van which swings and she barely misses being scraped by a bus. Abigail used the German profanity ""verdammt"", which is German for ""damn it"", to which Riley remarks ""pretty sure she was swearing"". Shaw also uses ""damn"" after Ben escapes with the Declaration of Independence in the Archives preservation room. Ian uses the English profanity bloody. There are just over a half-dozen interjections of my god, oh my lord, for gods sake, etc. One of the security guards in the film is named ""Mike Hawk"", which, when said quickly can be lewd"

National Treasure: Book of Secrets	PG	1	4	1	3	1	"Some brief kissing First scenes of the film show gun pointed to back of head and shot fired (Lincoln assassination). In a following scene, a child witnesses his father being shot; father dies moments later. No gore is seen from these shots. Some fisticuffs, but nothing too prolonged or intense. Some minor bleeding of the characters, but nothing significant. A semi-intense Car Chase scene that includes gunfire. Nobody is killed in this scene. There is a brief scene where Mitch pulls a knife on the Abigail, but no one is harmed. Nicolas Cage pretends to be drunk in one scene, and applies drinking alcohol on his tongue, and on his neck. There is a party scene (Presidential birthday party) where alcohol is being served, but is very subtle. Some younger kids may not get the plot. Some of the car chase scenes may be too intense for young children, and there are some scenes with skeletal remains that may frighten young children. There are some intense scenes where main characters are in mortal danger. There is one very brief use of the phrase ""My God."" No profanity."

The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian	PG	0	6	0	4	1	" Almost all violence in the film is in a battle/military context - it is neither bloody nor graphic and is not frightening. Blood shows up on a Telmarine general's lip after Miraz socks him in the face. And it spreads across Caspian's hand when the hag slashes it. Most often, though, when swords are plunged into bodies, they don't come out sheathed in red. But the point here is that swords are plunged into bodies. Repeatedly. As are crossbow bolts, arrows and knives. The fighting evokes images of ethnic cleansing as Telmarines seek to eradicate the Narnians from their own land. Defending the assault, Miraz hisses, ""They've been breeding like cockroaches under a rock."" A soldier's head is severed at one point. It's swift and not overly graphic, but we do see a helmet-clad orb roll away from the body. A minotaur is pushed off a high castle balcony, and the camera never blinks as he tumbles, crashes into a bulwark, then thuds to the ground, presumably dead. Equally intense is a scene in which another minotaur holds up a descending gate to allow his comrades to escape. The Telmarines riddle his body with arrows and he collapses, the gate slamming down on top of him. The remaining Narnians are trapped and await their doom. Huge catapults hurl boulders at the Narnians' makeshift fortress, blasting walls, bringing down doorways, etc. A ploy by the Narnians to collapse the earth underneath their enemies' feet succeeds, and we see dozens of horses and riders fall into the pit that's created. Trees awaken and wipe out sections of armored men and animals with their flailing roots and limbs. The river-goddepicted as water that coalesces into the rough form of a manrips a bridge from its tethers and destroys everyone on it. Hand-to-hand combat also gets front-and-center attention. Peter and Caspian violently cross swords before they discover they're on the same side. Caspian puts a sword to his uncle's throat, forcing him out of bed. And Peter takes on Miraz in an interminable and armor-denting test of superiority. Then, when Peter refuses to kill his fading opponent, one of Miraz's generals finishes the man off. (We see his body crumple with an arrow sticking out of it.) The dwarf Trumpkin is bound and gagged in a boat, then thrown overboard to drown. When Peter's shoulder is dislocated, Edmund wrenches it back into place. For a moment, Susan dangles (frighteningly) over a high ledge. In England, Peter gets into a frivolous fight with another boy. They push, shove, hit and kick.  As the four Pevencies are in Narnia at the beginning, they find out that their friends from the previous film are all gone. This can be really upsetting. Soldiers surround a bed and all shoot, intending to kill its occupant Hideous animals emerge from a dark opening and one calls up the spirit of the witch. An animal cuts Caspian's hand with a knife and it bleeds. The witch tries to coax Caspian into giving her a drop of Adam's blood. Intense battle action throughout. Idiot and Shut Up"

The Nativity Story	PG	2	6	3	5	1	Nothing major. People think that Mary has had an affair when she becomes pregnant while betrothed to Joseph. If this wasn't a religious film it would certainly be rated PG-13 at least. Some very disturbing and realistic violence. Implied slaying of baby boys. Implied slaying of sacrificial cow. Non-gory display of people who have been crucified. An implied circumcision. A moderately bloody scene of a man hanging by his limbs from a tree. None. Although there is a scene of people treading grapes, presumably to make wine. Also, during the scene when Joseph and Mary become betrothed, they both take a drink of wine. The scenes described above are very realistic and disturbing, not recommended for younger viewers. Soldiers harassment of families, taking away children as slaves. Implied childbirth (women acting like they're in a lot of pain and then the sound of babies crying) Implied killing of baby boys (families screaming and children crying) Joseph dreaming of Mary almost being stoned. None.

The Lake House	PG	3	1	1	1	1	No Sex. No Nudity. A man and a woman kiss passionately at a party. A woman wears low-cut tops that reveals cleavage. A man is struck by a bus and a car is struck by the same bus (we see the man lying still on the ground and hear later that he died). We see a man in a hospital after having had a heart attack. A man grieves over the death of his father. A woman describes the plot of a book that includes a description of a husband breaking his wife's neck with an ax. A dog runs away from a man, and he chases the dog. A woman kicks a floor angrily. People drink alcohol in a bar scene, two men drink beer in a bar, two men drink wine, women drink wine in a bar in a few scenes, and a woman drinks champagne in a restaurant. None. 4 scatological terms, 5 mild obscenities, name-calling (bitter old man, coward), 1 religious profanity, 4 religious exclamations. Profanity includes at least two Christ, Jesus and a G-D. At least 2 uses of s**t.

A Series of Unfortunate Events	PG	2	7	1	5	1	"Some of the cast are shown kissing, not passionately. Count Olaf attempts to force Violet(who is a minor) to marry him in an attempt to steal the money from the orphans. This movie does not contain blood or gore; however, there are some dark and disturbing elements. Its plot focuses on an old man trying to kill children. At the beginning of the movie it is implied that two people died in a burning house; the death is discussed throughout the movie. An old man is comically abusive towards three children and puts them in peril throughout the movie. The back of a dead body sitting in a chair can be seen. An old man makes several attempts to kill people including children (and successfully kills one man and allows a woman to die). An old man violently slaps a young boy. An old man blackmails a young girl, saying that he will kill her baby sister if she doesn't go through with marrying him. Some alcohol and tobacco consumption. This film and Barnyard are by far the darkest and scariest Nickelodeon films, due to the appearances of Count Olaf and Dag the Coyote. This movie focuses on an old man trying to kill some children in order to get their fortune. It is extremely dark, and includes many potentially disturbing themes such as death, suicide, murder, forced marriage, pedophilia, and more. Throughout the movie, children are often in danger. A scene involves them being trapped in a car on a railway with a train coming. Another intense scene, set during a storm, involves many flying, falling household items that put the children in peril of death. Carnivorous leeches attack a small wooden rowboat. Being leeches, they are not frightening, but they have sharp teeth. There is a ""jump"" moment in which a snake pops out of its cage, hissing. 3 ""damns,"" and a few uses of ""arse."" An infant uses words like ""schmuck,"" and ""bite me,"" etc."

Zathura: A Space Adventure	PG	0	2	1	2	2	" While one of the brothers tries to run away from the robot, the robot destroys a lot of stuff in the house. Intense Violence, brothers fight, aliens are killed (one crushed by a piano.) None The Zorgons (Reptilian Humanoids) appear at one point. Lots of suspense. There is an intense meteor shower, a robot that is intent on killing two small boys, some of the aliens have scary designs. We learn that they eat meat (people = meat). Within the first 5 minutes one of the brothers calls the other one a ""dick."" 1 use of dick, biatch, ass, god oh my god, screw and jerk 2 uses of heck 3 uses of sucks"

Spy Kids	PG	0	15	1	1	1	" A girl spits special gum on a ""thumb"" and causes it to convulse as if electrocuted, and drop to the floor; a ""thumb"" is electrocuted and killed. A girl kicks a boy off monkey bars; he falls and hits his face on the floor but is fine. A robot boy twists a girl's arm; then the girl punches the presumably metallic robot and her hand hurts. She then head-butts it, but just falls to the ground and her head now hurts. A man throws another man through a window, a man punches a window out and a man punches another in the face. Several ""thumbs"" attack a man, busting a wall down and capturing him. A boy pulls a man's leg and knocks him to the ground and a girl flips a man. Two kids are caught in a high speed boat-like vehicle that's out of control; a boy almost falls into the sea, but a girl pulls him back. A boat runs into another boat, ripping it in half. Two people are kidnapped and tied to chairs in two separate scenes (first with rope and then with colorful chains). A boy hits both a girl and a man in the head with a lunchbox. Kids throw toys at adults. A man grabs a girl's leg, and a woman is hit and knocked down by a small rocket; her hair catches fire (we see the flames on her head and later she's mostly bald). A robot girl lifts a boy over her head and spins him round and round. She then throws him down a corridor. He tries to tackle her but she shrugs him off with superhuman force, sending him sliding backwards. A robot boy tackles a girl, and a robot girl punches a pillar and damages it. A boy tries to do the same and he just causes himself pain (no injury). A robot girl lifts a boy by the neck and regards him sneeringly.. Carmen says to her uncle ""you're always traveling, and no one knows what you do for a living."" He replies with ""I think we all have uncles like that."" It would go over most people's heads, especially children, but it sounds like it is meant to be a reference to drug dealing. There are some surprisingly disturbing and dark scenes and creatures in this movie. In the movie they almost swore. They said shi the word close to shit."

Shrek Forever After	PG	3	7	1	6	2	"After Donkey falls into a trap baited with waffles, Shrek says ""my donkey fell in your waffle hole"" to Fiona as a double entendre reference to female genitalia. This may go over younger viewers' heads. When Shrek discovers that a true love's kiss will break Rumpelstiltskin's spell, Donkey refuses. When the Dragon appears, Shrek tells Donkey to ""woo her."" When Shrek arrives in the alternate universe, he falls to the ground really hard and implies that ""he thinks he fell on his keys"". A witch gets melted by being splashed by water. In the alternate timeline Puss eats Gingerbread Man, then says to Shrek ""Oh, were you going to eat that?"" Played for laughs. The Gingerbread Man is forced to fight animal crackers for entertainment and breaks them into pieces with a lollipop. Ogres drink eyeball cocktails and at one point Donkey amuses them by putting eyeballs in his nostrils. Repeated comical violence including fighting and imprisonment. The film's climactic battle could be viewed as intense and/or excessive by some young viewers. Shrek and Fiona fight during training, both punching and hitting each other. The ogres of the resistance drink cocktails with eyeballs in them. Shrek glows gold when he realizes his entire life is gone. At his triplet's birthday party, Shrek is under pressure too many times, and has an emotional outburst doing his famous ""Shrek"" roar. After Shrek is done scaring the villagers, he discovers wanted posters for Fiona in the forest. He quickly goes from being happy to being worried as he senses that something is wrong. This scene is very ominous and is followed by Shrek discovering his swamp burned down and his home abandoned/deserted. Rumplestiltskin waves around a glass of water subtly threatening to melt witches with it if they don't tell him a good plan to stop Shrek from getting a curse-breaking true love's kiss. When one witch suggests getting a bounty hunter, Rumpel gets excited and accidentally melts her with water, then shrugs it off. The complete disappearance of Fiona's parents and the partial disappearance of Shrek may upset and confuse younger viewers. The battle scene at the end is quite intense. 1 use of ass and mild name calling throughout. Donkey says ""hell no"" when asked to use his tongue to help clean Puss."

Shrek the Third	PG	7	7	3	3	7	"Shrek's buttocks are briefly shown during a bad dream. A bra is shown being lit on fire with a torch. A character is name Puss, and the word ""puss"" is heard many times throughout the film, but it is merely a cat's name, but not a vulgar slang term. Doris said Prince Charming made her ""hotter than July."" When Fiona moved a statue, it looked like a frog was kissing a horse's butt. Fiona discussed having baby ogres with Shrek. When they left for the boat, Puss said goodbye to mutiple cats he was in love with, and he had many girlfriends. A boy's nose bleeds twice in the film. When Merlin eats some small rocks, his teeth are shown with blood on them. Shrek accidentally kills a man off screen. Played for laughs. Shrek accidentally pushes a ship and sends it sailing. He tries to stop the ship by throwing a glass bottle at it, but it only makes the ship sink. The people on the ship then jump into the water. This is played for laughs. Shrek has an infant-induced nightmare, where newborn ogre babies are crashing things, but are not hurt, but this scene can scare many kids. A stampede of them chase Shrek. See Frightening and Intense scenes for more. Part of Shrek's stuffy and stiff royal costume pops off and hits Donkey. That sets off a comedy-based chain reaction of chaos where various things or characters accidentally smash into other things or characters, including a small fire breaking out. Overall fighting and slapstick throughout the film. A drug trip is implied. Two stoned teenage boys are shown on a campus when they exit a carriage. Two teenage boys posed as ""stoners"" and had smoke coming out of their ""hippie"" van and said, ""Don't burn all my frankincense and myrrh!"" Shrek's baby nightmare sequence may frighten younger viewers, however it is more comical than truly frightening. Some little kids might think ogres are scary. Final Note: A family film overall, but families with older kids and some teenagers might appreciate it more. Like all Shrek films, some mild obscenities are going to be heard throughout the film. Puss is used many times, but it is the name of a cat. Gross out humor (ex. Baby ogre vomiting on Shrek's face in his nightmare). At least 2 poop jokes. Donkey called Puss a fool. ""Loser"" was mentioned. Lame, stupid, idiot, jerk, stinkhole, dork, and cowards were used."

Shrek 2	PG	11	7	3	1	3	"Pinocchio is briefly seen wearing a thong. Shrek and Fiona kiss a few times. ""Sexy"" is used to refer to several things over the course of the film. Donkey innocently mentions getting Shrek out of some clothes. A group of women then gasp suggestively. implied kissing between charming and Doris A person adds ""Lust"" to a magical potion, but pours a massive amount in it. A character is named Puss, but he is a cat, so ""puss"" is heard many times, but never used as a vulgar slang term. The big, bad wolf read a Pork Illustrated magazine with a drawing of a pig in a bikini on the cover, and it was probably a parody of porny magazines. The Fairy Godmother's song Holding Out for a Hero had some mild innuendos in the lyrics. Donkey told Puss to get his ""cat cheeks"" out of his face when they were locked up in a treasure chest box. Donkey yelled at Puss and said, ""If we need an expert on licking ourselves, we'll give you a call!"" When Shrek passes out from drinking the Happily Ever After potion, he falls and lands on Puss. This is played for laughs. When Shrek needs Donkey to cry, Puss sneaks up on Donkey and violently stomps on his hoof. Donkey then screams in pain and cries a tear. Shrek and the king fight by arguing and throwing food Puss in Boots prances at and jumps on Shrek, digging at him with his claws (no blood). Donkey tries to kick the cat, but instead gets Shrek in the crotch, doubling him over in pain (and he makes a verbal reference to being hit in the testicles). After Fiona throws the mermaid back into the ocean, two large sharks are seen immediately going after her. Mainly slapstick/cartoon fantasy violence throughout. There is a battle towards the end of the movie (sword fighting and bow and arrows are fired) though no one seems seriously hurt. Puss in Boots is caught with catnip in his possession (an innuendo for weed). When Puss was going through the potions, some of them were named after common medicines. Men enter a bar on multiple occasions. Fairy godmother is making potions in the factory (complete with dark shadows and red light). 1 use of ass and mild name calling throughout. 4 uses of bloody Puss told Donkey, ""You still look like an ass to me."""

The Land Before Time	G	1	1	0	3	1	None. The fight between the Sharptooth (T-Rex) and Littlefoot's mom can get pretty intense.  Some scenes Sharptooth may frighten younger viewers. There are numerous scenes in which the main characters are in peril and face great dangers The death of Littlefoot's mother is a very sad scene that will upset very young children and even some adults Littlefoot then falls into a depression for some time after. A few uses of 'stupid'

Once Upon a Forest	G	1	1	1	5	1	None. The furlings are attacked by an owl with one eye. None. There's a scene where a glass bottle is thrown on the highway, breaking upon impact. This later causes a truck driver to crash and release poisonous gas which starts killing all the animals in the forest. There's a scene in which the three main characters are hunted by a big, menacing owl, which could be very scary to smaller children. The scene where Michelle finds her parents dead might be frightening to smaller children. For the majority of the film, the main characters believe everyone who lives in their forest home, including their parents, are dead. In spite of the cover of the video, this movie is know for some thematic elements in a G rated film of its time. If theatrically released today, it would have earned a PG rating, as it is sadly unsettling. None.

The Whipping Boy	G	1	1	1	1	1	No sex or nudity Nothing graphic and most is comedic. Scenes from English pub, but nothing to encourage others. None whatsover. None!

Rainbow Brite and the Star Stealer	G	0	0	0	0	0	    

Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland	G	1	1	1	0	1	Three characters set their clothes out to dry in one scene and at first it seem they were wearing nothing, but it turns out that their bodies are covered with giant cotton ball like suits. Another scene shows a character pressed against a woman's chest during a dance class, but there's nothing too sexual about it. A nightmare creature gets cut up in one scene, as well as another scene where a whole bunch of nightmare creatures get suck into a blackhole like vaccum. Nothing else was too violent about the film. Flip smokes a cigar.  none

Race for Your Life, Charlie Brown	G	0	6	0	2	1	" Snoopy punches a cat. Charlie Brown and his friends fall down a waterfall (they are not injured). The bullies wreck Charlie Browns raft twice. Sally threatens to punch a girls ""lights out"", but it never happens. Bullies throw snowballs at Charlie Brown and his friends. The bully's cat tries to attack snoopy and Woodstock several times.  The bullies are very mean, also somewhat disturbing. Would most likely be a PG rating in today's standards. Some mild language such as 'stupid'."

Snoopy Come Home	G	0	2	0	2	1	" In the beginning of the movie, Snoopy get in a bad mood because of the ""No Dogs Allowed"" signs ehe keeps running into. To feel better he takes Linus's, blanket and they fight and later fights Lucy with a boxing glove on his nose. Though their is no blood or scars, the characters do appear really beat up. A small girl grabs Snoopy around the neck multiple times and attempts to spank him; Woodstock crashes several times, some on his head.  After Snoopy leaves, Charlie Brown and the others start feeling regret and blame themselves for Snoopy leaving. 3/4ths in the film, Snoopy has a going away party to permanently leave Charlie Brown and the others to live with Lila, his former owner. The party scene has a lot of crying from all the characters who attended. The word ""stupid"" is used a few times"

The Muppets Take Manhattan	G	6	1	1	0	1	At a construction site, first one then three construction workers make catcalls at Miss Piggy. Three different times they tried to get her attention until she did an angry display of force. One couple is seen making out in the park, very brief. Piggy mentions that she wants to have children with Kermit. One muppet says, I don't take off my clothes for anyone, I don't care if it is artistic. The nurse mentions that Kermit was found without any clothes and that she tried to find out who he was by investigating the nearest nudist colonies. Miss Piggy is jealous of Kermit, because she believes he is in a relationship with Jenny. Minor slapstick violence, one character is hit by a car. Martin Price played by Dabney Coleman is clearly seen smoking throughout an early scene.  None

Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory	G	1	2	3	3	2	"Innuendo: A man says he's telling a computer ""exactly what it can do with a lifetime supply of chocolate."" Mild but a younger viewer likely won't understand the joke. We see a chicken's head get cut off during the tunnel scene, but it is only onscreen for a split second. Grandpa Joe mentions ""Being cut to ribbons"" however, this never happens. In his office Wonka is seen with a cigar Grandpa Joe mentions giving up tobacco. Willy Wonka says: ""liquor is quicker"". During the boat tunnel scene, Wonka sings an eerie sounding song as various scary images are projected on the walls whilst all the passengers are very frightened. Charlie and Grandpa Joe are almost violently killed by an exhaust fan. They narrowly escape. A child falls through a chute that leads to the incinerator. Her father jumps in after her. It is later revealed that they will be okay. Mr. Wonka says ""Hell"" though he is referring to the underworld, and not using it as an expletive. Some name-calling, such as ""nitwit,"" ""nit,"" and ""inhuman monster"" can be heard."

Beauty and the Beast	G	7	8	3	7	1	"A few mild kisses. A man's belt is removed from his pants, his underwear is shown, although it is played for laughs In a brief scene, the beast can be seen naked in the tub. Humorous, but not sexual. Gaston constantly pursues Belle to marry him which she tells him no and at one time threatens to send her father to an insane asylum as bribery. This may be seen as sexual harassment by some viewers. Some of Belle's dresses reveal a hint of cleavage. 3 women wear dresses that show off their large breasts, and they act flirtatiously around Gaston. When Gaston lifts them up in the air and drops them on LeFou, you can briefly see their undergarments. Gaston rips his shirt open to reveal his hairy chest. A wolf is thrown against a tree, if you listen closely you can hear what sounds like bones breaking. While Belle is treating his wound from being attacked by the wolves the Beast cries out in pain and the two start arguing. The baker's wife whacks him with a rolling pin in the opening song it's played out in a comedic way. Gaston shoots a bird that falls to the ground, presumably dead. Cogsworth is burned by Lumiere twice. manhandled by Maurice and run over with a tea cart. In each case, he doesn't suffer any long-term damage. Beast has several wounds after fighting with a pack of wolves. Some blood is briefly shown on his arm. Several moments of violence in a group battle scene between the villagers and castle objects. Mrs. Potts and the cups pour hot water on a villager. Le Fou threatens Lumiere with a torch, before Cogsworth stabs him in the rear. A feather duster has many feathers plucked out, until Lumiere burns the villager and saves her. Much of this scene is intended as comical. Two characters engage in a long fight to the death In the Be Our Guest scene, there are singing beer steins that have froth coming out of their mouths, as well as dancing wine glasses and champagne bottles that shoot open like fireworks. There are some brief references to beer in the bar and characters are seen with full beer mugs. During the ""Gaston"" song in the bar, the villagers sing about how no one ""takes shots"" like Gaston. Gaston fires three bullets from his gun into a barrel of an alcoholic beverage, it spills out, and some men fill their cups with it. Despite having a G rating the movie has some surprisingly violent scenes that may be unsettling for younger audiences. The ""Beauty and the Beast"" song at the end credits is somewhat sad. The Beast and Belle get into an argument while she is treating his wound from being attacked by the wolves. They raise their voices at eachother. Maurice becomes very ill and Gaston threatens to send him to a mental asylum if Belle refuses to marry him. Some young children might be frightened by The Beast in his early scenes. The cursed castle is decorated with statues of horned demons, snakes and the like to give the castle a gothic setting. Characters surrounded/attacked by wolves in two different scenes. 1 use of ""darn"", 1 use of ""Gosh"" and 1 use of ""what the devil""."

Gnomeo & Juliet	G	3	1	1	0	2	"When Gnomeo and Benny sneak into the Red Garden, Benny says ""I love going commando"" This will fly over kids heads. There are a number of very sexually suggestive comments: 1. Juliet says to a male gnome that his ""Tulips look limp."" 2. The frog asks ""Is his... big and pointy?""
3. Juliet says ""A squirrel dropped his nuts"" and a the frog adds ""Nuts the size of boulders."" A male gnome is seen bare-chested on multiple occasions and wearing bathing trunks. A male gnome is seen on multiple occasions wearing a thong-style bathing suit and his bare buttocks are seen on one occasion. A female gnome is seen wearing a mid-drift exposing shirt (we see cleavage) and tight, form-fitting pants. A male and a female gnome are seen washing themselves (fully clothed). The male gnome is seen rubbing his behind and washing his armpits.
A male gnome is stuck under a large bra, which is dragging across the ground. The gnome uses it as a rope to climb a chair. Two gnomes are killed in a battle. (See examples below) Destruction, and a brief mention of suicide. License plate (clearly visible only in a single frame) reads iluv 3eer  Insults/British slang like ""shut up,"" ""blasted,"" ""old cabbage,"" ""loser,"" ""daft,"" and ""codger."" One use of ""damn."" The song ""The Bitch is Back"" is mentioned in the credits."

Chitty Chitty Bang Bang	G	2	7	1	3	1	"Caractacus and Trudy kiss, after which she says ""Now you'll HAVE to marry me!"" A woman dances around in lingerie during one musical number. In dialogue, there are some violent threats about removing people's eyeballs to wear as earrings, pulling out teeth to use for necklaces, cutting off someone's head filling it with food and giving it to the dogs. These threats are not carried out. There are multiple scenes involving mild slapstick violence, all played for laughs. The Baron makes multiple attempts to murder his wife including shooting at her with a gun and nearly impaling her with a falling stake. Several dogs invade a factory, knocking people and vats of liquid over. One bites a man on the butt. The Baron's ship shoots cannonballs at the heroes in their car but nobody gets hit. Two men are tossed out of an airship into the sea. They cry out that they will drown but are later shown to have reached shore safely. The climax in which the children revolt against the Baron and his court involves a lot of slapstick such as guards slipping on wine, the Baron getting lifted into the air by a hook etc. No one is injured but a lot of people scream. Smoking and drinking takes place at the king's birthday party, it is seemed to suggest that some members may be drunk. A man talks about burning an old car that two children play on in great detail. He then snidely remarks that if they don't be quiet, he'll murder them (it is said more comically than threateningly) A car is shown driving off a cliff with four people in it, falling towards the sea for several seconds. However, the car sprouts wings and flies into the air. The Child Catcher with his big metal hook, greasy, black hair and grotesque nose. He forces his way into a house accompanied by soldiers, searching for the hiding children inside. He has a cage for children and tricks children to kidnap them. In one scene, he pushes two children into his caged wagon and laughs maniacally as they cry to be let out. They are later imprisoned in a tower, alone. We see large groups of children who've been hiding for years. When Grandpa says (of Mr. Coggins) ""...wouldn't light your pipe if his house was on fire"", often times his pronunciation of ""house"" is misinterpreted as ""ass"""

The Jungle Book 2	G	1	2	0	2	0	Ranjan shakes his little behind to imitate what he thinks was the thing that Shanti used to lure Mowgli into the village (all while saying she batted her brown eyes at him, something Mowgli's father says was the same trick his wife used on him). Mowgli's adoptive father shows Mowgli a nasty scar on his arm after Mowgli tries to go back to the jungle. Shere Khan grabs Kaa by the neck and squeezes quite tight, all while trying to get info out of him. Later, he has Lucky the vulture by the neck. We then hears sounds of violence (after the tiger notes the irony of the vulture's name), but don't see anything.  Mowgli gets caught by his adoptive father from trying to go back to the jungle and he gets in deep trouble for it. To which his adoptive father teaches him a lesson by banishing Mowgli to his room for the rest of the day to reflect on his wrongdoings and says he won't get any dinner either. We see Shere Khan's shadow as the tiger moves through the village looking for Mowgli (as everyone sleeps and with some ominous music playing). The men are finally alerted and then come at the tiger with spears and torches (the tiger jumps out of the village). Various humans then cross a river and head into the forbidden jungle at night. 

Charlotte's Web	G	1	1	1	1	1	"None. A man picks up a piglet, and then a heavy axe, and walks out of a stall where is confronted by his daughter who protests the fact that he is going to kill the piglet (the man relents).

A pig slams its head into a fence plank three times, until the plank falls off and the pig runs out of the yard. A rat with a yo-yo string around its neck is pulled back and onto its back when a sheep steps on the string. A goose slaps another goose on the head with its wing.
Spiders break out of their egg sack, shoot a strand of webbing into the air and sail away in the wind. A rat pulls a spider egg sack and drops it off a ledge to the hay-covered floor where it is picked up in a pig's mouth.

The ending will most likely upset any emotional people. 2 mild exclamations (bloody, ruddy), name-calling (stupid, hairball, creepy, disgusting, hideous)."

Mary Poppins	G	1	3	3	5	0	"There is no sex or nudity. A reoccurring character makes a reference to a location that is ""popular with jumpers"" in reference to suicide when a character is missing due to having been apparently fired from their job. In one point a penguin slaps another penguin just for laughs A fox flees for his life from aristocratic fox hunters, but Bert decides to intervene and help the fox escape. Mr. Banks mentions drinking sherry and smoking a pipe when he returns home from work. When Mary takes her share of her flavor-switching-medicine, she says ""Yum, rum punch."", and then she hiccups; it is implied she changed hers to an alcoholic drink. Typical old-fashioned cigar smoking. Mr. Banks is summoned to the bank after hours and he knows that he is likely about to be fired for his son inadvertently starting a bank run that embarrassed the institution. There is a long sequence of Mr. Banks walking to the bank in the darkened streets of London and feeling utterly lost and alone convinced that he is a failure who is about ruin his family. One of the musicians during the ""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"" sequence appears to resemble a stereotypical Asian, which may offend viewers. An old woman covered in ashes scares two children in a dark alleyway, but nothing very frightening. Shortly after, a viscous dog also threatens the children growling, though only momentarily. At one point, the Banks children get lost in the slums of the East End of London, and run into a soot-covered man who appears to be abducting them, but he turns out to be their trusted friend, Bert, who takes them safely home. Some children and others may find the voice and laughter of Uncle Albert (Ed Wynn) to be creepy and frightening. "

Cars	G	3	4	2	2	3	"Innuendo: When Mia and Tia speak to Lightning after the first race, they flash their headlights at him, a reference to breast flashing. Innuendo: A reporter asks if McQueen was in a magazine called ""Cargirl,"" which is a spoof of Playgirl. Sally has a ""tramp stamp"" style tattoo on her bumper. Lightning makes a tongue in cheek remark about it. In a nightmare sequence, we see Chick Hicks get chopped up by Frank. In the opening race, Chick Hicks causes a huge pileup with the other racers in an attempt to stop Lightning from beating him. Lightning makes it through the wreck effortlessly, but a lot of the racers involved in the wreck are badly injured, with one of the cars being really crumpled up and leaking oil. Most of this is played for laughs though. While all characters are vehicles, they do some pretty raucous like hit each other, careening off walls, trees, cones, tires and crash. In a dream, Lightning imagines himself as a jet fighter firing rockets at advancing War of the Worlds-like alien machines, which explode when hit by his weaponry, in his own movie, ""Lightning Storm"". lightning says that racecars don't need headlights since the road is always lit, another automobile replies ""so is brother but he still needs headlights"", could be a drug reference. The VW Bus is presumed to be on the drugs throughout the movie. He's this movies interpretation of a stereotypical hippy from the 60's and 70's. Many scenes that take place at night are a bit frightening. Nothing majorly concerning; this is a very kid-friendly film and the only thing that would likely bother parents is the language and possibly one innuendo. In the movie there is words like :""You Idiot"" ""You Fool"" ""You're Stupid"" ""You Moron"" ""What an Idiot"" ""Hillbilly Hell"" Tractors are so dumb"" It has words like : ""You Idiot"" ""You Fool"" ""You're Stupid"" ""You Moron"" ""What an Idiot"" ""Hillbilly Hell"" Tractors are so dumb"" McQueen says to the group at a gas station that Doc Hudson won Piston cups. Mater does a spit take with oil in his mouth and says ""he did WHAT in his cup?!"" It's a good joke but relies on the viewer to know what ""piss"" means and interpret the word ""piss""."

Peter Pan 2: Return to Never Land	G	0	2	1	3	5	" After Jane's disbelief in fairies, Tinkerbell has repeated minor aneurysms (Sicknesses). This is disturbing. Hook's men shoot canon balls at Peter Pan and one of the men repeatedly swings a bat at him, but Peter Pan easily avoids all of that. Peter Pan then whacks that man with the bat, sending him flying into some netting that bends and then shoots that man into others, knocking them down. Captain Hook smokes The part where Jane harshly tells her baby brother, Daniel, about Peter Pan and Neverland are nothing but ""childish nonsense"" during a heated argument as he becomes heartbroken earlier in the film is really upsetting. If you were in Wendy's position, you'd be sorry for him. Tinkerbell is having a few strokes and heart attacks after Jane's disbelief in fairies. Set in WWII, London during the Blitz we hear the sounds of warfare (bombings) and see the results of that (bombed out and/or burning buildings), but don't actually see any such warfare in person. One scene, however, has Jane running home as the air raid sirens go off and bombs land nearby (and she's nearly hit by some large trucks that zip by on the street). Meanwhile, Wendy and her young son are in a bomb shelter that shakes from the explosions and Danny is scared. 1 use of 'good heavens'. 5 uses of 'gosh'. 1 exclamatory use of 'goodness'. 2 expletive uses of 'blast'. 1 use each of 'curse you', 'curses', and 'that cursed crocodile'."

The Little Mermaid	G	9	8	1	5	1	"When she is a mermaid, Ariel wears nothing but a seashell bra, which shows off a bit of her cleavage. This is the case for all mermaids featured in the film. There is a scene where Ariel is given a bath. While no private parts are seen, it is clear she is fully nude. When Ariel is first given legs, she is clearly nude from the waist down. Her buttocks appear on camera for a split second but it's very hard to notice since she swims away super quickly. After Flounder and Sebastian get the now-human Ariel to the surface, her buttocks are briefly visible again when she takes her first breath. Also later when Ariel tries to stand up in the shallow water, there's a brief view of the side of her buttocks. Ursula's breasts often bounce. In one shot, she shakes them and the camera zooms in on them. Ursula tells Ariel to use body language to attract her man, and dances sensually, by moving her hips. Before, she was using a sensual dance move when a woman moves their shoulders to move her breasts. Ariel begins to transform into a sea polyp and her shell bra disappears. In one brief shot, her breasts are bare, with her arm covering her nipples. Her bra reappears once she transforms back into a human. When Ursula turns into a human to seduce Prince Eric in one shot she rubs one of her breasts against his arm while cuddling him. At Ursula and Eric's wedding birds fly under Ursula's dress making it fly up giving a split second view of her panties. Blood is briefly present during the song ""Les Poissons"". After being turned into a human, Ariel begins to drown. A shark snaps and chomps as it chases Ariel and her fish-friend Flounder. A storm throws a ship onto rocks and the ship catches fire and later explodes. A dog onboard is endangered briefly. The prince nearly drowns. The sea king destroys Ariel's treasures in a fit of rage. The sea witch transforms mer-people into anthropomorphic sea polyps. Ursula momentarily grabs a detached human tongue and throws it into her cauldron. Grimsby lights a pipe. Ariel thinks it's a musical instrument and blows soot all over his face. The shipwreck sequence can be frightening. A shark attacks without injury to any characters. The scene in which the sea king destroys Ariel's treasures can be frightening. Ariel's transformation into a human can be disturbing. Ghostly hands enter her mouth and take her voice. The sea witch laughs maniacally. In a rapidly cut scene, her tail fin is split and turned into legs. She is then left to drown before being saved by her friends. The cursed creatures (sea polyps) might be frightening. ""Idiot"" is heard once"

A Bug's Life	G	3	11	1	3	3	"Flick and Atta flirt. Budding romance with Flik and Atta. The character Francis is a ladybug who often plays in drag, and is mistaken for being a female by two flies. This becomes a recurring joke throughout the rest of the film. Hopper grabs Dot by her head and attempts to feed her to a grasshopper. P.T. Flea is burnt by a fiery explosion, but he survives and it is played for comedic effect. While a bird is chasing the band of bugs, a rock falls on Francis breaking his leg (he is later seen with a cast), and a second rocks falls on his head knocking him unconscious. Hopper crushes three grasshoppers to death by launching mounds of grains on them as they scream in terror. Grasshoppers reveal they will ""squish"" the ant queen. A grashopper chases Dot through a field of thistles, and one of the spiky flowers is launched towards him and he squeals. Bugs spread red berry-juice on themselves to trick other bugs into thinking they're mutilated. (Played for laughs). Some bugs pull out Hopper's antenna. A grasshopper hits Flik several times, beating him with a broomstick After a rainstorm interrupts that, Hopper grabs Flik by the neck and starts to strangle him for fooling him with a fake bird, but a real bird comes along, grabs Hopper and feeds him to its babies. Some young bugs draw a mural that portrays a lot of blood (including a severed caterpillar). In a bar that Flik enters, it is suggested the customers (who are bugs) are drinking alcoholic beverages, like madiera. He slurps it fast, and crashes a car into a mailvan. Hopper and other grasshoppers have menacing appearances, along with their meanspirited disposition and treatment of the ants. Dim is portrayed as a raging monster. The scene ends when he is accidentally hurt and starts crying. Dot, being chased by the grasshoppers, appears to have been beaten about 100 times. Purity strong for a ""G rated Disney movie"" Rosie says ""oh would you shut up"" but this is nothing and it's it Someone name calling for example: Moron"

Chicken Run	G	6	6	4	1	2	"Mild flirtation between the male character and some of the others. The two main characters share a kiss. The chickens use a shower to hide. Nude buttocks are seen when two hens are dating in a shower cabinet. Fowler describes Americans as being 'oversexed'. The chickens use a pair of underpants as a tail for their escape plane. A man is ""goosed"" by his wife at one point (accompanied by a cartoonish horn sound effect), but there is little attention drawn to it and it goes no further onscreen. A hen is carried by her neck and gets beheaded off-screen. A woman gets thrown off a golf buggy. Mrs Tweedy kicks her husband in the backside. He is later seen with a footprint in the spot where it happened. Rocky is knocked out with a black eye in a fight, with one eye popped out, laying on the floor. Very graphic but only seen for two seconds. (He himself is on the floor, his eye stays in its socket.) A rooster is comically slapped in the face by a chicken. A bad character constantly has accidents with a pie machine. An empty tobacco pipe is used as a trumpet, then later as a horn. It later is recycled for a shower head when a shower breaks. A chicken takes a bottle of duffbeer and slams the shower door. Rocky and Ginger are seen binge-drinking. Later on, they crash a car into a van. A very brief joke about a cocktail, when a character is drinking water in a posh fashion. A brawl is started, with shouting and screaming for their lives. One of the two mice says ""Bloomin' Hell"". Mr. Tweedy calls all the chickens ""thieving little buggers""."

Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius	G	7	40	2	8	3	"Two boys talk about puberty and it makes one boy cry. We see a boy getting dressed and he wears only his boxer shorts. Three girls admire a boy and one flirts with him. Sheen pees in the shower in two, very brief, cutaways as part of a montage. His naughty bits are obscured by shower steam. A robot dog asks his creator to make him a female poodle companion. When the parents are transported to the alien ship, one man had been sitting on the toilet (he's still seated with his pants around his ankles as he floats through the air toward the ship. One of the ships that the children build is shaped like buttocks and one scene shows something being positioned for insertion. Most of the aliens in this movie look like green, slimy slugs swimming in egg-shaped glass containers that have a metal plate with pointed teeth. An alien eats a furry creature. As a punishment, an alien is sucked out into space through a large tube. A large alien in an egg-shaped container begins to hatch, blowing off the top of the egg and poking three tentacled eyes out of the hole and pushing two large scaled claws out of the bottom (when we see the whole alien it resembles a chicken with pointed teeth in its beak, a large slimy tongue, tiny wings and dragon-like legs). The chicken-alien pecks at humans lined up at its feet (once getting its beak stuck in a stage floor). A group of alien ships fly into the sun and explode. A group of children are chased by alien spaceships and are fired upon. A ship flies into the chicken-alien's head, it wobbles and falls on top of some other aliens. A huge stadium is filled with cheering aliens when a group of humans is marched out and prepared for sacrifice. A group of children fight with some aliens; one alien is kicked and crashes into a wall, another is sprayed with asthma spray and flies into a wall, and another explodes when a walkman is turned up really loud. A group of children in spaceships fly through a meteor shower and are pummeled by flaming meteors. A boy beats up some guards with a spear-like weapon. A boy enlarges himself, blows on a ship and it flies backward and blows up. A boy is tasered. A robot dog is strapped to a table and an alien scientist prepares to disassemble him. A boy in an aircraft crashes through a bell tower, bounces on rooftops and into a roof knocking the chimney off a house, which crumbles onto a car. A boy is ejected from a flying aircraft and his parachute gets entwined in a tree leaving him dangling upside down. Two boys and a robot dog fly very fast trying to leave the atmosphere, the engines die and the aircraft plummets toward the Earth. A robot dog explodes blowing up an alien guard and blowing open a cell door, and a robot dog explodes leaving shrapnel and a crater in the floor. A boy flies with a rocket pack through traffic after bouncing off a few walls. A boy flies with a rocket pack around a room crashing into walls, dragging a woman along with him and setting the curtains on fire. A boy throws a toaster into the air and it flies back and hits him on the head. A robot dog bites an alien's arm and he's taken away to be ""torn apart."" Children are locked in a dark dungeon and we see alien rodents skittering along pipes. A ""girl-eating plant"" with really large pointed teeth snaps at a girl when it is left outside her door, and takes a bite out of a picture of a girl. A boy bouncing in a bubble crashes into a tree and splatters goo all over himself. A boy miniaturizes himself and the shrink ray gadget falls on him. A boy sprays his asthma inhaler into his eyes and yells. A woman is miniaturized by a shrink ray and is threatened by a huge worm coming out of an apple (the worm has a large round mouth full of rows of pointed teeth); the woman uses a pencil to defend herself. An amusement park ride has glowing red eyes and a mouth with big teeth as its entrance; there are apparently flames inside. We see an alien skeleton chained to a dungeon wall. Children carrying torches walk zombie-like toward a boy. Humans are shown with mind control devices attached to their heads. Children panic and begin to cry when they realize that there is no one around to make their ouchies, owies and tummy aches feel better. A pie fight breaks out in a restaurant and many kids get pies in the face. A robot programmed to dress a boy gives him a wedgie when putting his pants on, and a robot ties a boy's shoes together so when he tries to walk he falls flat on the floor. A robo-dog passes nuts and bolts on a doorstep, a boy lifts the robot dog's tail and sprays foam on a fire. A boy vomits on an amusement park ride (we don't see any goo, just hear the sounds.) A boy makes a reference to urinating in the shower. We travel through a boy's ear canal and into his brain and see electrical flashes a couple of times. A boy, woman, man and dog burp very loudly a few times. after the party in RetroLand without parents, in the morning, when Jimmy is having a headache and stomach pain, Nick said ""...I remember my first time"", could be innocent for kids but it has an alcohol reference for adults None. This is a G rated film. The scene that involves the meteor shower can be quite intense for young children. A monstrous chicken-like creature has three eyes (and that of a close-up view of the inside of its mouth/throat). Carl mourns at a alien skeleton while in the dungeon, then gets frightened by a spider that just shows up. There are a few scenes involving separation and grieving over the loss of parents, which may upset some viewers. In one scene, before Nick finishes his ""scary story"", a kid suddenly jumps in front of him out of nowhere. this could cause a few jump scares. During the credits shows us what happend to Jimmy's teacher Ms. Fowl after he shrunk her in the beginning of the movie. She is seen riding a worm to the cafeteria A caterpillar from the first film. When Miss Fowl accidentally gets shrunk by Jimmy's shrink ray the Caterpillar tried to eat her An anatomical reference, exclamations like ""holy cow pie"" and ""we're gonna kick some alien buttocks."" A ride is named ""bat outta heck."" An obvious reference to the phrase ""bat outta hell."" Some teasing and name calling."

Ponyo	G	2	16	2	3	3	"none A girl hugs a boy tightly and rubs her face against his A woman drives her son along the highway at the edge of the sea during a storm; she drives recklessly, the car skids to a stop and she and her little boy exit, but the wind blows the boy over the rail and toward the sea (he is caught). A mother and small boy in a car nearly run head-on into a van on a narrow winding road. A five-year-old boy uses matches to light a candle three times and burns his finger once and yells ""Ouch!"" A mother leaves her 5-year-old son and his same-aged female playmate home alone late at night and the boy becomes afraid when the mom does not return. A boy and girl (both 5 years old) walk through a long, dark tunnel and halfway through she begins to turn into a fish and collapses; the boy cries, and carries her out to the shoreline, and he dunks her in the water to revive her (she awakens). Several short scenes feature family arguments: A husband and his wife argue over the phone and by signal beacon, and she slams the phone down and later slams a pot of greens into a sink. A girl-fish argues several times with her human father about living on land and he locks her in a bubble; she escapes, and this is repeated three times. An old woman in a nursing home screams when a little boy shows her a goldfish with the face of a little girl; the old woman screams that it is bad luck and the fish must go back to the sea. Several scenes depict dark-blue, big-eyed water blobs that grumble: They lap up onto a shoreline and snatch back a girl-fish after she tries to swim away, they splash up onto the shore to drive back a little boy, who looks frightened, and they search for the girl-fish several times, they grumble and gather together to form a wall to lift a man up and onto an island but fail and fall back into the sea, and in a few other scenes they swim pass ships at sea and shake them. Huge sea-blue fish escape from an underwater aquarium and rise to the surface to become waves that churn up a typhoon and rain; a small girl runs along their backs, but is not injured. In one scene the girl rubs her head on a baby's forehead to heal it, leaving faint red ovals on his forehead and cheeks. During the healing, her fingers and toes change from 5 digits to 3 fingers and toes on each limb; afterward, she has 5 digits on each limb again. A small fish licks a drop of blood we see on a boy's thumb, instantly healing a small cut we cannot see. Several schools of giant fish accidentally break though the door of a vault and are caught in a potion in a stone basin that causes the fish to fly upward. Two shore scenes feature hundreds of insects in the foreground. A character opens a beer can which overflows. Alcohol is not consumed. A male human-looking character under the sea drinks elixirs from four tall bottles and from a fifth he pours a glowing golden potion and when he drinks the last drops from the bottle, he states, ""I can feel the power of it down into my DNA."" Waves with eyes try to get boy near water. There's little violence, although a few scenes during and after a climactic storm may be intense. Some scenes in which characters seem to be missing might also be upsetting. A few uses of Baka, which means idiot. 17 mild obscenities (""bug off!""), 3 stereotypical comments about humans as naturally destructive, 3 religious exclamations. Name-calling (freak show, weird, human, ugly.)"

The Princess Diaries	G	5	6	1	4	2	"A group of bullies pushes over a changing tent with Mia inside it she is wrapped up in a towel as she is surrounded by the paparazzi. Mia accidentally breaks a finger off a statue and places it in it's mouth and party guests have an alarmed reaction to it later in the film. Cheerleaders wear mini skirts and several students are shown in bathing suits at a beach party . Some heavy kissing. Mia mentions ""waiting for normal body parts to arrive"" Mia shoves an ice cream cone down the front of Lana's cheer uniform as an act of revenge. Mia starts getting nauseous while giving a speech in class she then rushes out of the room gagging and heaving. She is then mocked by a group of cheerleaders who one pantomimes vomiting with her pompoms. Lana Anna and Fontanna are very mean to Mia throughout the film. A guy gets hit in the crotch during a ball game. A woman loses control of her car and it crashes into a trolley bus. A woman is very clumsy and falls down a lot (mostly played for comedy.) A woman takes a glass of brandy away from a man and tells him to go ""easy on the Schnapps"" and to remember the winter dinner (implying he might have gotten drunk then). Mia crashes her car into a trolley after the brake fails there are no injuries but she is pardoned by the police when they find out she is royalty. Mia is very upset after the changing tent scene and is shown crying in her mother's lap. Lana, Anna and Fontana are very cruel to Mia throughout the film the worst of the bullying is when they push over a changing tent when she is inside it as she is swarmed by paparazzi. Mia has an emotional meltdown in the middle of a rainstorm when her car stops running. A nun says ""Oh for the love of God."" The expression ""shut up"" is used multiple times throughout."

Horton Hears a Who!	G	0	5	1	3	1	" Kangaroo field goal kicks one of the students (Or Katie the yellow yak) through the air. A man is thrown about and is pinned by heavy furniture. A scary vulture attacks an elephant to take a flower from him. The mayor gets a stapler stuck to his head. Twice. While believing that the flower in question does not contain a world of people, a villain that is hired to destroy it promises his new boss that he will ""devour"" the flower, then ""regurgitate it"", and then ""devour it again"". (used for comedic effect) None. The ending is chaotic and somewhat violent. The voucher and his attack may be frightening to children. The Sour Kangaroo and Wickersham Brothers are very mean and frightening characters that will possibly scare some small children. In the audio commentary for one of the deleted scenes (on the special edition DVD and Blu-Ray), there is a mention of a literal ""asskicking machine""."

Toy Story 2	G	0	1	1	2	0	 At the airport, The Prospector punches Buzz in the face and then is drawn into a scuffle with Woody. None. Jessie's flashback to her time with Emily is quite emotional. None. 

Robin Hood	G	6	3	2	5	1	"Lady Kluck's bottoms are pulled about halfway down her butt showing her purple underwear with pink polka dots Sis wears pink bloomers that show under her dress. Little John disguises himself as a woman and hides a great deal of coins in his shirt, making him appear to have large breasts. A guard notices this and whistles at him. A badminton birdie briefly falls inside Lady Kluck's cleavage. As she is a bird, she shouldn't even have breasts. Klucky gets a wedgie near the end of the archery tournament. Little John says, ""Snatch his underwear"" during the song that humiliated Prince John. Skippy gets into a play fight with Lady Cluck and hits her foot with a toy sword. He worries briefly about whether he's hurt her for real, but he hasn't. The fight scenes during the archery tournament segment are done in a comedic matter and is tame. Prince John is sometimes violent towards Sir Hiss; he smashes a mirror on Hiss' head (no blood shown), fists his head to which Hiss responds 'thank you sir', ties him up against a post (in a comedic manner) and kicks Hiss on the head while sleeping and as discipline for Hiss for hissing in John's foot. Prince John is seen with a jug of wine. There is a scene where Sir Hiss (the snake) is shoved into a barrel by Friar Tuck (the badger) and Alan-A-Dale (the rooster) containing an alcoholic substance. Sir Hiss says he doesn't drink. He later appears intoxicated when Prince John lets him out of the barrel. A character's beheading is ordered and we see the rather sinister-looking headsman approaching with his axe, but the character is saved and nothing further happens. Children seen arguing. Many scenes with felonious activities (mostly adults, however children as well) Talk of hanging and dying. Noose seen being tied. Crossbow arrow is shot and flies around bouncing off wall/ground missing spooked characters. God bless, Thank God and Thank the Lord."

Alice in Wonderland	G	1	2	3	3	4	"An adult joke as when the dodo tries to light Alice on fire, he tries to do it in between her legs. The Queen of Hearts says ""Off with his/her head!"" several times but we never see the acts take place. Mild cartoon action throughout. -G Various drug references. moderate smoking references The Caterpillar is seen smoking a hookah and the dodo bird carries a cigar. Alice breaks down and cries twice. When she cries in the woods it may make some kids sad. A character grooms, lures away, and then eats baby oysters whose shells resemble bonnets. The eating is not seen, but their empty shells are shown afterwards. Children may find the ""Very Good Advice"" song/scene very sad. Alice cries during and after. The flowers call Alice a ""Weed"" A bird calls Alice a ""Serpent"" Alice calls the Queen of Hearts a ""Fat, pompous, bad tempered, old tyrant"" There is no swearing, but there are a few insults throughout the movie"
